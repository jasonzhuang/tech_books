Instead, we will go through the solution to two problems, discussing
some interesting algorithms and techniques along the way. If this does
not sound interesting to you, it is safe to skip to the next chapter.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Let me introduce our first problem. Take a look at this map. It shows
Hiva Oa, a small tropical island in the Pacific Ocean.</p><div class="illustration"><img src="img/Hiva Oa.png"/></div><p>The grey lines are roads, and the numbers next to them are the lengths
of these roads. Imagine we need a program that finds the shortest
route between two points on Hiva Oa. How could we approach that? Think
about this for a moment.</p><p>No really. Don't just steamroll on to the next paragraph. Try to
seriously think of some ways you could do this, and consider the
issues you would come up against. When reading a technical book, it is
way too easy to just zoom over the text, nod solemnly, and promptly
forget what you have read. If you make a sincere effort to solve a
problem, it becomes <em>your</em> problem, and its solution will be more
meaningful.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The first aspect of this problem is, again, representing our data. The
information in the picture does not mean much to our computer. We
could try writing a program that looks at the map and extracts the
information in it... but that can get complicated. If we had
twenty-thousand maps to interpret, this would be a good idea, in this
case we will do the interpretation ourself and transcribe the map into
a more computer-friendly format.</p><p>What does our program need to know? It has to be able to look up which
locations are connected, and how long the roads between them are. The
places and roads on the island form a <a name="key1"></a>graph, as mathematicians call
it. There are many ways to store graphs. A simple possibility is to
just store an array of road objects, each of which contains properties
naming its two endpoints and its length...</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">roads</span> = [{<span class="property">point1</span>: <span class="string">&quot;Point Kiukiu&quot;</span>, <span class="property">point2</span>: <span class="string">&quot;Hanaiapa&quot;</span>, <span class="property">length</span>: <span class="atom">19</span>},

             <span class="comment">/* and so on */</span>];</pre><p>However, it turns out that the program, as it is working out a route,
will very often need to get a list of all the roads that start at a
certain location, like a person standing on a crossroads will look at
a signpost and read &quot;Hanaiapa: 19km, Mount Feani: 15km&quot;. It would be
nice if this was easy (and quick) to do.</p><p>With the representation given above, we have to sift through the whole
list of roads, picking out the relevant ones, every time we want this
signpost list. A better approach would be to store this list directly.
For example, use an object that associates place-names with signpost
lists:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">roads</span> = {<span class="string">&quot;Point Kiukiu&quot;</span>: [{<span class="property">to</span>: <span class="string">&quot;Hanaiapa&quot;</span>, <span class="property">distance</span>: <span class="atom">19</span>},
                              {<span class="property">to</span>: <span class="string">&quot;Mt Feani&quot;</span>, <span class="property">distance</span>: <span class="atom">15</span>},
                              {<span class="property">to</span>: <span class="string">&quot;Taaoa&quot;</span>, <span class="property">distance</span>: <span class="atom">15</span>}],
             <span class="string">&quot;Taaoa&quot;</span>: [<span class="comment">/* et cetera */</span>]};</pre><p>When we have this object, getting the roads that leave from Point
Kiukiu is just a matter of looking at <code>roads[&quot;Point Kiukiu&quot;]</code>.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>However, this new representation does contain duplicate information:
The road between A and B is listed both under A and under B. The first
representation was already a lot of work to type in, this one is even
worse.</p><p>Fortunately, we have at our command the computer's talent for
repetitive work. We can specify the roads once, and have the correct
data structure be generated by the computer. First, initialise an
empty object called <code>roads</code>, and write a function <code>makeRoad</code>:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">roads</span> = {};
<span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">makeRoad</span>(<span class="variabledef">from</span>, <span class="variabledef">to</span>, <span class="variabledef">length</span>) {
  <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variabledef">addRoad</span>(<span class="variabledef">from</span>, <span class="variabledef">to</span>) {

  }
  <span class="localvariable">addRoad</span>(<span class="localvariable">from</span>, <span class="localvariable">to</span>);
  <span class="localvariable">addRoad</span>(<span class="localvariable">to</span>, <span class="localvariable">from</span>);
}</pre><p>Nice, huh? Notice how the inner function, <code>addRoad</code>, uses the same
names (<code>from</code>, <code>to</code>) for its parameters as the outer function. These
will not interfere: inside <code>addRoad</code> they refer to <code>addRoad</code>'s
parameters, and outside it they refer to <code>makeRoad</code>'s parameters.</p><p>The <code>if</code> statement in <code>addRoad</code> makes sure that there is an array of
destinations associated with the location named by <code>from</code>, if there
isn't already one it puts in an empty array. This way, the next line
can assume there is such an array and safely push the new road onto
it.</p><p>Now the map information looks like this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">makeRoad</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Point Kiukiu&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;Hanaiapa&quot;</span>, <span class="atom">19</span>);

(most likely) give you a different number every time. The function

and rounds the result down with <code>Math.floor</code>. Thus, for example,
<code>randomInteger(3)</code> will produce the number <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>2</code>.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The gambler's method is the way to go for those who abhor structure
and planning, who desperately search for adventure. We set out to
write a program that could find the <em>shortest</em> route between places
though, so something else will be needed.</p><p>A very straightforward approach to solving such a problem is called
'<a name="key4"></a>generate and test'. It goes like this:</p><ol><li>Generate all possible routes.</li><li>In this set, find the shortest one that actually connects the start point to the end point.</li></ol><p>Step two is not hard. Step one is a little problematic. If you allow
routes with circles in them, there is an infinite amount of routes. Of
course, routes with circles in them are unlikely to be the shortest
route to anywhere, and routes that do not start at the start point do
not have to be considered either. For a small graph like Hiva Oa, it
should be possible to generate all non-cyclic (circle-free) routes
starting from a certain point.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>But first, we will need some new tools. The first is a function named
<code>member</code>, which is used to determine whether an element is found
within an array. The route will be kept as an array of names, and when
arriving at a new place, the algorithm calls <code>member</code> to check whether
we have been at that place already. It could look like this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">member</span>(<span class="variabledef">array</span>, <span class="variabledef">value</span>) {

immediately at the first position. What wastefulness. When using a
<code>for</code> loop, you can use the <code>break</code> statement to jump out of it, but
in a <code>forEach</code> construct this will not work, because the body of the
loop is a function, and <code>break</code> statements do not jump out of
functions. One solution could be to adjust <code>forEach</code> to recognise a
certain kind of exceptions as signalling a break.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">Break</span> = {<span class="property">toString</span>: <span class="keyword">function</span>() {<span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">&quot;Break&quot;</span>;}};

the exception and stop looping. The object stored in the variable
<code>Break</code> is used purely as a thing to compare with. The only reason I
gave it a <code>toString</code> property is that this might be useful to figure
out what kind of strange value you are dealing with if you somehow end
up with a <code>Break</code> exception outside of a <code>forEach</code>.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Having a way to break out of <code>forEach</code> loops can be very useful, but
in the case of the <code>member</code> function the result is still rather ugly,

given a <code>value</code> property, and have <code>forEach</code> return this value when
such an exception is thrown, but this would be terribly ad-hoc and

an array of places that the route passes, and a length. <code>findRoutes</code>
recursively continues a route, returning an array with every possible
extension of that route. When the end of a route is the place where we
want to go, it just returns that route, since continuing past that
place would be pointless. If it is another place, we must go on. The
<code>flatten</code>/<code>map</code>/<code>filter</code> line is probably the hardest to read. This is
what it says: 'Take all the roads going from the current location,
discard the ones that go to places that this route has already
visited. Continue each of these roads, which will give an array of
finished routes for each of them, then put all these routes into a
single big array that we return.'</p><p>That line does a lot. This is why good abstractions help: They allow
you to say complicated things without typing screenfulls of code.</p><p>Doesn't this recurse forever, seeing how it keeps calling itself (via
<code>continueRoute</code>)? No, at some point, all outgoing roads will go to
places that a route has already passed, and the result of <code>filter</code>
will be an empty array. Mapping over an empty array produces an empty
array, and flattening that still gives an empty array. So calling
<code>findRoutes</code> on a dead end produces an empty array, meaning 'there are
no ways to continue this route'.</p><p>Notice that places are appended to routes by using <a name="key9"></a><code>concat</code>, not

the <code>mapSize</code> an argument to <code>possibleDirections</code>, so we can use the
function for different maps without changing it. I judged that that
was not necessary in this case though, such things can always be
changed when the need arises.</p><p>Then why didn't I also add a variable to hold the <code>0</code>, which also
occurs two times? I assumed that maps always start at <code>0</code>, so this one
is unlikely to ever change, and using a variable for it only adds
noise.</p></div></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>To find a route on this map without having our browser cut off the
program because it takes too long to finish, we have to stop our
amateurish attempts and implement a serious algorithm. A lot of work
has gone into problems like this in the past, and many solutions have
been designed (some brilliant, others useless). A very popular and
efficient one is called <a name="key12"></a>A* (pronounced A-star). We will spend the
rest of the chapter implementing an A* route-finding function for our
map.</p><p>Before I get to the algorithm itself, let me tell you a bit more about
the problem it solves. The trouble with searching routes through
graphs is that, in big graphs, there are an awful lot of them. Our
Hiva Oa path-finder showed that, when the graph is small, all we needed
to do was to make sure our paths didn't revisit points they had
already passed. On our new map, this is not enough anymore.</p><p>The fundamental problem is that there is too much room for going in
the wrong direction. Unless we somehow manage to steer our exploration
of paths towards the goal, a choice we make for continuing a given
path is more likely to go in the wrong direction than in the right
direction. If you keep generating paths like that, you end up with an
enormous amount of paths, and even if one of them accidentally reaches
the end point, you do not know whether that is the shortest path.</p><p>So what you want to do is explore directions that are likely to get
you to the end point first. On a grid like our map, you can get a
rough estimate of how good a path is by checking how long it is and
how close its end is to the end point. By adding path length and an
estimate of the distance it still has to go, you can get a rough idea
of which paths are promising. If you extend promising paths first, you
are less likely to waste time on useless ones.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>But that still is not enough. If our map was of a perfectly flat
plane, the path that looked promising would almost always be the best
one, and we could use the above method to walk right to our goal. But
we have valleys and hillsides blocking our paths, so it is hard to
tell in advance which direction will be the most efficient path.
Because of this, we still end up having to explore way too many paths.</p><p>To correct this, we can make clever use of the fact that we are
constantly exploring the most promising path first. Once we have
determined that path A is the best way to get to point X, we can
remember that. When, later on, path B also gets to point X, we know
that it is not the best route, so we do not have to explore it
further. This can prevent our program from building a lot of pointless
paths.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The algorithm, then, goes something like this...</p><p>There are two pieces of data to keep track of. The first one is called
the open list, it contains the partial routes that must still be
explored. Each route has a score, which is calculated by adding its
length to its estimated distance from the goal. This estimate must
always be optimistic, it should never overestimate the distance. The
second is a set of nodes that we have seen, together with the shortest
partial route that got us there. This one we will call the reached
list. We start by adding a route that contains only the starting node
to the open list, and recording it in the reached list.</p><p>Then, as long as there are any nodes in the open list, we take out the
one that has the lowest (best) score, and find the ways in which it
can be continued (by calling <code>possibleDirections</code>). For each of the
nodes this returns, we create a new route by appending it to our
original route, and adjusting the length of the route using
<code>weightedDistance</code>. The endpoint of each of these new routes is then
looked up in the reached list.</p><p>If the node is not in the reached list yet, it means we have not seen
it before, and we add the new route to the open list and record it in
the reached list. If we <em>had</em> seen it before, we compare the score of
the new route to the score of the route in the reached list. If the
new route is shorter, we replace the existing route with the new one.
Otherwise, we discard the new route, since we have already seen a
better way to get to that point.</p><p>We continue doing this until the route we fetch from the open list
ends at the goal node, in which case we have found our route, or until
the open list is empty, in which case we have found out that there is
no route. In our case the map contains no unsurmountable obstacles, so
there is always a route.</p><p>How do we know that the first full route that we get from the open
list is also the shortest one? This is a result of the fact that we
only look at a route when it has the lowest score. The score of a
route is its actual length plus an <em>optimistic</em> estimate of the
remaining length. This means that if a route has the lowest score in
the open list, it is always the best route to its current endpoint ―
it is impossible for another route to later find a better way to that
point, because if it were better, its score would have been lower.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Try not to get frustrated when the fine points of why this works are
still eluding you. When thinking about algorithms like this, having
seen 'something like it' before helps a lot, it gives you a point of
reference to compare the approach to. Beginning programmers have to do
without such a point of reference, which makes it rather easy to get
lost. Just realise that this is advanced stuff, globally read over the
rest of the chapter, and come back to it later when you feel like a
challenge.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>I am afraid that, for one aspect of the algorithm, I'm going to have
to invoke magic again. The open list needs to be able to hold a large
amount of routes, and to quickly find the route with the lowest score
among them. Storing them in a normal array, and searching through this
array every time, is way too slow, so I give you a data structure
called a <a name="key13"></a>binary heap. You create them with <code>new</code>, just like <code>Date</code>
objects, giving them a function that is used to 'score' its elements
as argument. The resulting object has the methods <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>,
just like an array, but <code>pop</code> always gives you the element with the
lowest score, instead of the one that was <code>push</code>ed last.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">identity</span>(<span class="variabledef">x</span>) {

to take a look at it.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The need to squeeze out as much efficiency as we can has another
effect. The Hiva Oa algorithm used arrays of locations to store
routes, and copied them with the <code>concat</code> method when it extended
them. This time, we can not afford to copy arrays, since we will be
exploring lots and lots of routes. Instead, we use a 'chain' of
objects to store a route. Every object in the chain has some
properties, such as a point on the map, and the length of the route so
far, and it also has a property that points at the previous object in
the chain. Something like this:</p><div class="illustration"><img src="img/objectchain.png"/></div><p>Where the cyan circles are the relevant objects, and the lines
represent properties ― the end with the dot points at the value of
the property. Object <code>A</code> is the start of a route here. Object <code>B</code> is
used to build a new route, which continues from <code>A</code>. It has a
property, which we will call <code>from</code>, pointing at the route it is based
on. When we need to reconstruct a route later, we can follow these
properties to find all the points that the route passed. Note that
object <code>B</code> is part of two routes, one that ends in <code>D</code> and one that
ends in <code>E</code>. When there are a lot of routes, this can save us much
storage space ― every new route only needs one new object for itself,
the rest is shared with other routes that started the same way.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><a name="exercise5"></a><div class="exercisenum">Ex. 7.5</div><div class="exercise"><p>Write a function <code>estimatedDistance</code> that gives an optimistic estimate

distance between the points, that would also work. What we need is an

certainly optimistic. However, the closer the estimate is to the real

}</pre><p>First, it creates the data structures it needs, one open list and one
reached list. <code>routeScore</code> is the scoring function given to the binary
heap. Note how it stores its result in the route object, to prevent
having to re-calculate it multiple times.</p><p><code>addOpenRoute</code> is a convenience function that adds a new route to both
the open list and the reached list. It is immediately used to add the
start of the route. Note that route objects always have the properties
<code>point</code>, which holds the point at the end of the route, and <code>length</code>,
which holds the current length of the route. Routes which are more
than one square long also have a <code>from</code> property, which points at
their predecessors.</p><p>The <code>while</code> loop, as was described in the algorithm, keeps taking the
lowest-scoring route from the open list and checks whether this gets
us to the goal point. If it does not, we must continue by expanding
it. This is what the <code>forEach</code> takes care of. It looks up this new
point in the reached list. If it is not found there, or the node found
has a longer length than the new route, a new route object is created
and added to the open list and reached list, and the existing route
(if any) is removed from the open list.</p><p>What if the route in <code>known</code> is not on the open list? It has to be,
because routes are only removed from the open list when they have been
found to be the most optimal route to their endpoint. If we try to
remove a value from a binary heap that is not on it, it will throw an
exception, so if my reasoning is wrong, we will probably see an
exception when running the function.</p><p>When code gets complex enough to make you doubt certain things about
it, it is a good idea to add some checks that raise exceptions when
something goes wrong. That way, you know that there are no weird
things happening 'silently', and when you break something, you
immediately see what you broke.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Note that this algorithm does not use recursion, but still manages to
explore all those branches. The open list more or less takes over the
role that the function call stack played in the recursive solution to
the Hiva Oa problem ― it keeps track of the paths that still have to
be explored. Every recursive algorithm can be rewritten in a
non-recursive way by using a data structure to store the 'things that
must still be done'.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Well, let us try our path-finder:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">route</span> = <span class="variable">findRoute</span>(<span class="variable">point</span>(<span class="atom">0</span>, <span class="atom">0</span>), <span class="variable">point</span>(<span class="atom">19</span>, <span class="atom">19</span>));</pre><p>If you ran all the code above, and did not introduce any errors, that
call, though it might take a few seconds to run, should give us a
route object. This object is rather hard to read. That can be helped

enough, will show a route on a map.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">showRoute</span>(<span class="variable">route</span>);</pre><p>You can also pass multiple routes to <code>showRoute</code>, which can be useful

graph can be applied to many problems, many of which are not at all
related to finding a physical path. For example, a program that needs
to solve a puzzle of fitting a number of blocks into a limited space
could do this by exploring the various 'paths' it gets by trying to
put a certain block in a certain place. The paths that ends up with
insufficient room for the last blocks are dead ends, and the path that
manages to fit in all blocks is the solution.</p></div><ol class="footnotes"><li><a name="footnote1"></a>Computers are deterministic machines: They always react in the same
