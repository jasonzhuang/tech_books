inspect or modify the document is generally not enough. We also need
to be able to detect what the user is doing, and respond to it. For
this, we will use a thing called <a name="key1"></a>event handlers. Pressed keys are
events, mouse clicks are events, even mouse motion can be seen as a
series of events. In <a href="chapter11.html">chapter 11</a>, we added an <code>onclick</code> property to a
button, in order to do something when it was pressed. This is a simple
event handler.</p><p>The way browser events work is, fundamentally, very simple. It is
possible to register handlers for specific event types and specific
DOM nodes. Whenever an <a name="key2"></a>event occurs, the handler for that event, if
any, is called. For some events, such as key presses, knowing just
that the event occurred is not good enough, you also want to know
which key was pressed. To store such information, every event creates
an <a name="key3"></a>event object, which the handler can look at.</p><p>It is important to realise that, even though events can fire at any
time, no two handlers ever run at the same moment. If other JavaScript
code is still running, the browser waits until it finishes before it
calls the next handler. This also holds for code that is triggered in
other ways, such as with <code>setTimeout</code>. In programmer jargon, browser
JavaScript is <a name="key4"></a>single-threaded, there are never two '<a name="key5"></a>threads'
running at the same time. This is, in most cases, a good thing. It is
very easy to get strange results when multiple things happen at the
same time.</p><p>An event, when not handled, can 'bubble' through the DOM tree. What
this means is that if you click on, for example, a link in a
paragraph, any handlers associated with the link are called first. If
there are no such handlers, or these handlers do not indicate that
they have finished handling the event, the handlers for the paragraph,
which is the parent of the link, are tried. After that, the handlers
for <code>document.body</code> get a turn. Finally, if no JavaScript handlers
have taken care of the event, the browser handles it. When clicking a
link, this means that the link will be followed.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>So, as you see, events are easy. The only hard thing about them is
that browsers, while all supporting more or less the same
functionality, support this functionality through different
interfaces. As usual, the most incompatible browser is Internet
Explorer, which ignores the standard that most other browsers follow.
After that, there is Opera, which does not properly support some
useful events, such as the <code>onunload</code> event which fires when leaving a
page, and sometimes gives confusing information about keyboard events.</p><p>There are four event-related actions one might want to take.</p><ul><li>Registering an event handler.</li><li>Getting the event object.</li><li>Extracting information from this object.</li><li>Signalling that an event has been handled.</li></ul><p>None of them work the same across all major browsers.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>As a practice field for our event-handling, we open a document with a
button and a text field. Keep this window open (and attached) for the
rest of the chapter.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">attach</span>(<span class="variable">window</span>.<span class="property">open</span>(<span class="string">&quot;example_events.html&quot;</span>));</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The first action, registering a handler, can be done by setting an
element's <code>onclick</code> (or <code>onkeypress</code>, and so on) property. This does
in fact work across browsers, but it has an important drawback ― you
can only attach one handler to an element. Most of the time, one is
enough, but there are cases, especially when a program has to be able
to work together with other programs (which might also be adding
handlers), that this is annoying.</p><p><a name="key6"></a>In Internet Explorer, one can add a click handler to a
button like this:</p><pre class="code invalid"><span class="variable">$</span>(<span class="string">&quot;button&quot;</span>).<span class="property">attachEvent</span>(<span class="string">&quot;onclick&quot;</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>(){<span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Click!&quot;</span>);});</pre><p><a name="key7"></a>On the other browsers, it goes like this:</p><pre class="code invalid"><span class="variable">$</span>(<span class="string">&quot;button&quot;</span>).<span class="property">addEventListener</span>(<span class="string">&quot;click&quot;</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>(){<span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Click!&quot;</span>);},
                             <span class="atom">false</span>);</pre><p>Note how <code>&quot;on&quot;</code> is left off in the second case. The third argument
to <code>addEventListener</code>, <code>false</code>, indicates that the event should
'bubble' through the DOM tree as normal. Giving <code>true</code> instead can be
used to give this handler priority over the handlers 'beneath' it, but
since Internet Explorer does not support such a thing, this is rarely
useful.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><a name="exercise1"></a><div class="exercisenum">Ex. 13.1</div><div class="exercise"><p>Write a function called <code>registerEventHandler</code> to wrap the
incompatibilities of these two models. It takes three arguments: first
a DOM node that the handler should be attached to, then the name of
the event type, such as <code>&quot;click&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;keypress&quot;</code>, and finally the
handler function.</p><p>To determine which method should be called, look for the methods
themselves ― if the DOM node has a method called <code>attachEvent</code>, you
may assume that this is the correct method. Note that this is much
preferable to directly checking whether the browser is Internet
Explorer. If a new browser arrives which uses Internet Explorer's
model, or Internet Explorer suddenly switches to the standard model,
the code will still work. Both are rather unlikely, of course, but
doing something in a smart way never hurts.</p></div><div class="solution"><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">registerEventHandler</span>(<span class="variabledef">node</span>, <span class="variabledef">event</span>, <span class="variabledef">handler</span>) {

clicks his mouse, three events are generated. First <a name="key16"></a><code>mousedown</code>, at
the moment the mouse button is pressed. Then, <a name="key17"></a><code>mouseup</code>, at the
moment it is released. And finally, <a name="key18"></a><code>click</code>, to indicate something
was clicked. When this happens two times in quick succession, a
<a name="key19"></a><code>dblclick</code> (double-click) event is also generated. Note that it is
possible for the <code>mousedown</code> and <code>mouseup</code> events to happen some time
apart ― when the mouse button is held for a while.</p><p>When you attach an event handler to, for example, a button, the fact
that it has been clicked is often all you need to know. When the
handler, on the other hand, is attached to a node that has children,
clicks from the children will 'bubble' up to it, and you will want to
find out which child has been clicked. For this purpose, event objects
have a property called <a name="key20"></a><code>target</code>... or <code>srcElement</code>, depending on the
browser.</p><p><a name="key21"></a><a name="key22"></a>Another interesting piece of information
are the precise coordinates at which the click occurred. Event objects
related to the mouse contain <a name="key23"></a><code>clientX</code> and <a name="key24"></a><code>clientY</code> properties,
which give the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the mouse, in pixels, on the
screen. Documents can scroll, though, so often these coordinates do
not tell us much about the part of the document that the mouse is
over. Some browsers provide <a name="key25"></a><code>pageX</code> and <a name="key26"></a><code>pageY</code> properties for
this purpose, but others (guess which) do not. Fortunately, the
information about the amount of pixels the document has been scrolled
can be found in <code>document.body.scrollLeft</code> and
<code>document.body.scrollTop</code>.</p><p>This handler, attached to the whole document, intercepts all mouse
clicks, and prints some information about them.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">reportClick</span>(<span class="variabledef">event</span>) {

you want to do in every single event handler. In a moment, after we
have gotten acquainted with a few more incompatibilities, we will
write a function to 'normalise' event objects to work the same across
browsers.</p><p>It is also sometimes possible to find out which mouse button was
pressed, using the <a name="key27"></a><code>which</code> and <a name="key28"></a><code>button</code> properties of event
objects. Unfortunately, this is very unreliable ― some browsers
pretend mouses have only one button, others report right-clicks as
clicks during which the control key was held down, and so on.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a name="key29"></a><a name="key30"></a><a name="key31"></a>Apart from clicks, we
might also be interested in the movement of the mouse. The
<a name="key32"></a><code>mousemove</code> event of a DOM node is fired whenever the mouse moves
while it is over that element. There are also <a name="key33"></a><code>mouseover</code> and
<a name="key34"></a><code>mouseout</code>, which are fired only when the mouse enters or leaves a
node. For events of this last type, the <code>target</code> (or <code>srcElement</code>)
property points at the node that the event is fired for, while the
<a name="key35"></a><code>relatedTarget</code> (or <code>toElement</code>, or <code>fromElement</code>) property gives
the node that the mouse came from (for <code>mouseover</code>) or left to (for
<code>mouseout</code>).</p><p><code>mouseover</code> and <code>mouseout</code> can be tricky when they are registered on
an element that has child nodes. Events fired for the child nodes will
bubble up to the parent element, so you will also see a <code>mouseover</code>
event when the mouse enters one of the child nodes. The <code>target</code> and
<code>relatedTarget</code> properties can be used to detect (and ignore) such
events.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a name="key36"></a><a name="key37"></a><a name="key38"></a>For every key that the user
presses, three events are generated: <a name="key39"></a><code>keydown</code>, <a name="key40"></a><code>keyup</code>, and

you really want to know which key was pressed, for example when you
want to do something when the arrow keys are pressed. <code>keypress</code>, on
the other hand, is to be used when you are interested in the character
that is being typed. The reason for this is that there is often no
character information in <code>keyup</code> and <code>keydown</code> events, and Internet
Explorer does not generate a <code>keypress</code> event at all for special keys
such as the arrow keys.</p><p>Finding out which key was pressed can be quite a challenge by itself.
For <code>keydown</code> and <code>keyup</code> events, the event object will have a
<a name="key42"></a><code>keyCode</code> property, which contains a number. Most of the time, these
codes can be used to identify keys in a reasonably browser-independent
way. Finding out which code corresponds to which key can be done by
simple experiments...</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">printKeyCode</span>(<span class="variabledef">event</span>) {

key on your keyboard. The Opera browser, however, will generate
different key codes for some keys depending on whether shift is
pressed or not. Even worse, some of these shift-is-pressed codes are
the same codes that are also used for other keys ― shift-9, which on
most keyboards is used to type a parenthesis, gets the same code as
the down arrow, and as such is hard to distinguish from it. When this
threatens to sabotage your programs, you can usually resolve it by
ignoring key events that have shift pressed.</p><p>To find out whether the shift, control, or alt key was held during a
key or mouse event, you can look at the <a name="key43"></a><code>shiftKey</code>, <a name="key44"></a><code>ctrlKey</code>, and
<a name="key45"></a><code>altKey</code> properties of the event object.</p><p>For <code>keypress</code> events, you will want to know which character was
typed. The event object will have a <a name="key46"></a><code>charCode</code> property, which, if
you are lucky, contains the <a name="key47"></a>Unicode number corresponding to the
character that was typed, which can be converted to a 1-character
string by using <a name="key48"></a><code>String.fromCharCode</code>. Unfortunately, some browsers
do not define this property, or define it as <code>0</code>, and store the
character code in the <a name="key49"></a><code>keyCode</code> property instead.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">printCharacter</span>(<span class="variabledef">event</span>) {

we are ready for more challenging feats of document-manipulation. As
an exercise, we will implement the game known as <a name="key55"></a>Sokoban. This is
something of a classic, but you may not have seen it before. The rules
are this: There is a grid, made up of walls, empty space, and one or
more 'exits'. On this grid, there are a number of crates or stones,
and a little dude that the player controls. This dude can be moved
horizontally and vertically into empty squares, and can push the
boulders around, provided that there is empty space behind them. The
goal of the game is to move a given number of boulders into the exits.</p><p>Just like the terraria from <a href="chapter8.html">chapter 8</a>, a Sokoban level can be represented
as text. The variable <code>sokobanLevels</code>, in the <code>example_events.html</code>
window, contains an array of level objects. Each level has a property
<code>field</code>, containing a textual representation of the level, and a
property <code>boulders</code>, indicating the amount of boulders that must be
expelled to finish the level.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">sokobanLevels</span>.<span class="property">length</span>);
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">sokobanLevels</span>[<span class="atom">1</span>].<span class="property">boulders</span>);
<span class="variable">forEach</span>(<span class="variable">sokobanLevels</span>[<span class="atom">1</span>].<span class="property">field</span>, <span class="variable">print</span>);</pre><p>In such a level, the <code>#</code> characters are walls, spaces are empty
squares, <code>0</code> characters are used for for boulders, an <code>@</code> for the
starting location of the player, and a <code>*</code> for the exit.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>But, when playing the game, we do not want to be looking at this
textual representation. Instead, we will put a <a name="key56"></a>table into the
document. I made small <a name="key57"></a>style-sheet (<a href="css/sokoban.css">sokoban.css</a>,
if you are curious what it looks like) to give the cells of this table
a fixed square size, and added it to the example document. Each of the
cells in this table will get a background image, representing the type
of the square (empty, wall, or exit). To show the location of the
player and the boulders, images are added to these table cells, and
moved to different cells as appropriate.</p><p>It would be possible to use this table as the main representation of
our data ― when we want to look whether there is a wall in a given
square, we just inspect the background of the appropriate table cell,
and to find the player, we just search for the image node with the
correct <code>src</code> property. In some cases, this approach is practical, but
for this program I chose to keep a separate data structure for the
grid, because it makes things much more straightforward.</p><p>This data structure is a two-dimensional grid of objects, representing
the squares of the playing field. Each of the objects must store the
type of background it has and whether there is a boulder or player
present in that cell. It should also contain a reference to the table
cell that is used to display it in the document, to make it easy to
move images in and out of this table cell.</p><p>That gives us two kinds of objects ― one to hold the grid of the
playing field, and one to represent the individual cells in this grid.
If we want the game to also do things like moving the next level at
the appropriate moment, and being able to reset the current level when
you mess up, we will also need a 'controller' object, which creates or
removes the field objects at the appropriate moment. For convenience,
we will be using the prototype approach outlined at the end of <a href="chapter8.html">chapter 8</a>,
so object types are just prototypes, and the <code>create</code> method, rather
than the <code>new</code> operator, is used to make new objects.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Let us start with the objects representing the squares of the game's

they submit. It can be stopped to prevent the submit from taking
place. This gives us a <em>much</em> better way to do the form validation we
saw in the previous chapter. You just register a <code>submit</code> handler,
which stops the event when the content of the form is not valid. That
way, when the user does not have JavaScript enabled, the form will
still work, it just won't have instant validation.</p><p><a name="key67"></a><a name="key68"></a>Window objects have a <a name="key69"></a><code>load</code> event that fires
when the document is fully loaded, which can be useful if your script
needs to do some kind of initialisation that has to wait until the
whole document is present. For example, the scripts on the pages for
this book go over the current chapter to hide solutions to exercises.
You can't do that when the exercises are not loaded yet. There is also
an <a name="key70"></a><code>unload</code> event, firing when the user leaves the document, but
this is not properly supported by all browsers.</p><p><a name="key71"></a>Most of the time it is best to leave the laying out of a
document to the browser, but there are effects that can only be
produced by having a piece of JavaScript set the exact sizes of some
nodes in a document. When you do this, make sure you also listen for
<a name="key72"></a><code>resize</code> events on the window, and re-calculate the sizes of your
element every time the window is resized.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Finally, I have to tell you something about event handlers that you
would rather not know. The Internet Explorer browser (which means, at
the time of writing, the browser used by a majority of web-surfers)
has a bug that causes values to not be cleaned up as normal: Even when
they are no longer used, they stay in the machine's memory. This is
known as a <a name="key73"></a>memory leak, and, once enough memory has been leaked,
will seriously slow down a computer.</p><p>When does this leaking occur? Due to a deficiency in Internet
Explorer's <a name="key74"></a>garbage collector, the system whose purpose it is to
reclaim unused values, when you have a DOM node that, through one of
its properties or in a more indirect way, refers to a normal
JavaScript object, and this object, in turn, refers back to that DOM
node, both objects will not be collected. This has something to do
with the fact that DOM nodes and other JavaScript objects are
collected by different systems ― the system that cleans up DOM nodes
will take care to leave any nodes that are still referenced by
JavaScript objects, and vice versa for the system that collects normal
JavaScript values.</p><p>As the above description shows, the problem is not specifically
related to event handlers. This code, for example, creates a bit of
un-collectable memory:</p><pre class="code invalid"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">jsObject</span> = {<span class="property">link</span>: <span class="variable">document</span>.<span class="property">body</span>};
<span class="variable">document</span>.<span class="property">body</span>.<span class="property">linkBack</span> = <span class="variable">jsObject</span>;</pre><p>Even after such an Internet Explorer browser goes to a different page,
it will still hold on to the <code>document.body</code> shown here. The reason
this bug is often associated with event handlers is that it is
extremely easy to make such circular links when registering a handler.
The DOM node keeps references to its handlers, and the handler, most
of the time, has a reference to the DOM node. Even when this reference
is not intentionally made, JavaScript's scoping rules tend to add it
implicitly. Consider this function:</p><pre class="code invalid"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">addAlerter</span>(<span class="variabledef">element</span>) {
  <span class="variable">addHandler</span>(<span class="localvariable">element</span>, <span class="string">&quot;click&quot;</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
    <span class="variable">alert</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Alert! ALERT!&quot;</span>);
  });
}</pre><p>The anonymous function that is created by the <code>addAlerter</code> function
can 'see' the <code>element</code> variable. It doesn't use it, but that does not
matter ― just because it can see it, it will have a reference to it.
By registering this function as an event handler on that same
<code>element</code> object, we have created a circle.</p><p>There are three ways to deal with this problem. The first approach, a
very popular one, is to ignore it. Most scripts will only leak a
little bit, so it takes a long time and a lot of pages before the
problems become noticeable. And, when the problems are so subtle,
who's going to hold <em>you</em> responsible? Programmers given to this
approach will often searingly denounce Microsoft for their shoddy
programming, and state that the problem is not their fault, so <em>they</em>
shouldn't be fixing it.</p><p>Such reasoning is not entirely without merit, of course. But when half
your users are having problems with the web-pages you make, it is hard
to deny that there is a practical problem. Which is why people working
on 'serious' sites usually make an attempt not to leak any memory.
Which brings us to the second approach: Painstakingly making sure that
no circular references between DOM objects and regular objects are
created. This means, for example, rewriting the above handler like
this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">addAlerter</span>(<span class="variabledef">element</span>) {
  <span class="variable">addHandler</span>(<span class="localvariable">element</span>, <span class="string">&quot;click&quot;</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
    <span class="variable">alert</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Alert! ALERT!&quot;</span>);
  });
  <span class="localvariable">element</span> = <span class="atom">null</span>;
}</pre><p>Now the <code>element</code> variable no longer points at the DOM node, and the
handler will not leak. This approach is viable, but requires the
programmer to <em>really</em> pay attention.</p><p>The third solution, finally, is to not worry too much about creating
leaky structures, but to make sure to clean them up when you are done
with them. This means unregistering any event handlers when they are
no longer needed, and registering an <code>onunload</code> event to unregister
the handlers that are needed until the page is unloaded. It is
possible to extend an event-registering system, like our <code>addHandler</code>
function, to automatically do this. When taking this approach, you
must keep in mind that event handlers are not the only possible source
of memory leaks ― adding properties to DOM node objects can cause
similar problems.</p></div><div class="navigation"><a href="chapter12.html">&lt;&lt; Previous chapter</a> | <a href="contents.html">Contents</a> | <a href="index.html">Cover</a> | <a href="chapter14.html">Next chapter &gt;&gt;</a></div><div class="footer">© <a href="mailto:marijnh@gmail.com">Marijn Haverbeke</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">license</a>), written March to July 2007, last modified on April 4 2012.</div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="js/mochi.js"> </script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/codemirror.js"> </script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/ejs.js"> </script></body></html>
