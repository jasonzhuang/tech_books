In the
process, we will discuss two new types of values, arrays and objects,
and look at some techniques related to them.</p><p>Consider the following situation: Your crazy aunt Emily, who is
rumoured to have over fifty cats living with her (you never managed to
count them), regularly sends you e-mails to keep you up to date on her
exploits. They usually look like this:</p><blockquote>Dear nephew,<br/><br/>Your mother told me you have taken up skydiving. Is this true? You
watch yourself, young man! Remember what happened to my husband? And
that was only from the second floor!<br/><br/>Anyway, things are very exciting here. I have spent all week trying to
get the attention of Mr. Drake, the nice gentleman who moved in next
door, but I think he is afraid of cats. Or allergic to them? I am
going to try putting Fat Igor on his shoulder next time I see him,
very curious what will happen.<br/><br/>Also, the scam I told you about is going better than expected. I have
already gotten back five 'payments', and only one complaint. It is
starting to make me feel a bit bad though. And you are right that it
is probably illegal in some way.<br/><br/>(... etc ...)<br/><br/>Much love,
Aunt Emily<br/><br/>died 27/04/2006: Black Leclère<br/><br/>born 05/04/2006 (mother Lady Penelope): Red Lion, Doctor Hobbles the
3rd, Little Iroquois</blockquote><p>To humour the old dear, you would like to keep track of the genealogy
of her cats, so you can add things like &quot;P.S. I hope Doctor Hobbles
the 2nd enjoyed his birthday this Saturday!&quot;, or &quot;How is old Lady
Penelope doing? She's five years old now, isn't she?&quot;, preferably
without accidentally asking about dead cats. You are in the possession
of a large quantity of old e-mails from your aunt, and fortunately she
is very consistent in always putting information about the cats'
births and deaths at the end of her mails in precisely the same
format.</p><p>You are hardly inclined to go through all those mails by hand.
Fortunately, we were just in need of an example problem, so we will
try to work out a program that does the work for us. For a start, we
write a program that gives us a list of cats that are still alive
after the last e-mail.</p><p>Before you ask, at the start of the correspondence, aunt Emily had
only a single cat: Spot. (She was still rather conventional in those
days.)</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><div class="picture"><img src="img/eyes.png"/></div></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>It usually pays to have some kind of clue what one's program is going
to do before starting to type. Here's a plan:</p><ol><li>Start with a set of cat names that has only &quot;Spot&quot; in it.</li><li>Go over every e-mail in our archive, in chronological order.</li><li>Look for paragraphs that start with &quot;born&quot; or &quot;died&quot;.</li><li>Add the names from paragraphs that start with &quot;born&quot; to our set of names.</li><li>Remove the names from paragraphs that start with &quot;died&quot; from our set.</li></ol><p>Where taking the names from a paragraph goes like this:</p><ol><li>Find the colon in the paragraph.</li><li>Take the part after this colon.</li><li>Split this part into separate names by looking for commas.</li></ol><p>It may require some suspension of disbelief to accept that aunt Emily
always used this exact format, and that she never forgot or misspelled
a name, but that is just how your aunt is.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>First, let me tell you about <a name="key1"></a>properties. A lot of JavaScript values
have other values associated with them. These associations are called
properties. Every string has a property called <a name="key2"></a><code>length</code>, which refers
to a number, the amount of characters in that string.</p><p><a name="key3"></a>Properties can be accessed in two ways:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">text</span> = <span class="string">&quot;purple haze&quot;</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">text</span>[<span class="string">&quot;length&quot;</span>]);
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">text</span>.<span class="property">length</span>);</pre><p>The second way is a shorthand for the first, and it only works when
the name of the property would be a valid variable name ― when it
doesn't have any spaces or symbols in it and does not start with a
digit character.</p><p>The values <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> do not have any properties. Trying
to read properties from such a value produces an error. Try the
following code, if only to get an idea about the kind of error-message
your browser produces in such a case (which, for some browsers, can be
rather cryptic).</p><pre class="code invalid"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">nothing</span> = <span class="atom">null</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">nothing</span>.<span class="property">length</span>);</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The properties of a string value can not be changed. There are quite a
few more than just <code>length</code>, as we will see, but you are not allowed
to add or remove any.</p><p>This is different with values of the type <a name="key4"></a>object. Their main role is
to hold other values. They have, you could say, their own set of
tentacles in the form of properties. You are free to modify these,
remove them, or add new ones.</p><p><a name="key5"></a>An object can be written like this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">cat</span> = {<span class="property">colour</span>: <span class="string">&quot;grey&quot;</span>, <span class="property">name</span>: <span class="string">&quot;Spot&quot;</span>, <span class="property">size</span>: <span class="atom">46</span>};
<span class="variable">cat</span>.<span class="property">size</span> = <span class="atom">47</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">cat</span>.<span class="property">size</span>);
<span class="keyword">delete</span> <span class="variable">cat</span>.<span class="property">size</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">cat</span>.<span class="property">size</span>);
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">cat</span>);</pre><p>Like variables, each property attached to an object is labelled by a
string. The first statement creates an object in which the property
<code>&quot;colour&quot;</code> holds the string <code>&quot;grey&quot;</code>, the property <code>&quot;name&quot;</code> is attached
to the string <code>&quot;Spot&quot;</code>, and the property <code>&quot;size&quot;</code> refers to the number
<code>46</code>. The second statement gives the property named <code>size</code> a new
value, which is done in the same way as modifying a variable.</p><p>The keyword <a name="key6"></a><code>delete</code> cuts off properties. Trying to read a
non-existent property gives the value <code>undefined</code>.</p><p>If a property that does not yet exist is set with the <a name="key7"></a><code>=</code> operator,
it is added to the object.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">empty</span> = {};
<span class="variable">empty</span>.<span class="property">notReally</span> = <span class="atom">1000</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">empty</span>.<span class="property">notReally</span>);</pre><p>Properties whose names are not valid variable names have to be quoted
when creating the object, and approached using brackets:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">thing</span> = {<span class="string">&quot;gabba gabba&quot;</span>: <span class="string">&quot;hey&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;5&quot;</span>: <span class="atom">10</span>};
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">thing</span>[<span class="string">&quot;5&quot;</span>]);
<span class="variable">thing</span>[<span class="string">&quot;5&quot;</span>] = <span class="atom">20</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">thing</span>[<span class="atom">2</span> + <span class="atom">3</span>]);
<span class="keyword">delete</span> <span class="variable">thing</span>[<span class="string">&quot;gabba gabba&quot;</span>];</pre><p>As you can see, the part between the brackets can be any expression.
It is converted to a string to determine the property name it refers
to. One can even use variables to name properties:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">propertyName</span> = <span class="string">&quot;length&quot;</span>;
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">text</span> = <span class="string">&quot;mainline&quot;</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">text</span>[<span class="variable">propertyName</span>]);</pre><p>The operator <a name="key8"></a><code>in</code> can be used to test whether an object has a
certain property. It produces a boolean.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">chineseBox</span> = {};
<span class="variable">chineseBox</span>.<span class="property">content</span> = <span class="variable">chineseBox</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="string">&quot;content&quot;</span> in <span class="variable">chineseBox</span>);
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="string">&quot;content&quot;</span> in <span class="variable">chineseBox</span>.<span class="property">content</span>);</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>When object values are shown on the console, they can be clicked to
inspect their properties. This changes the output window to an
'inspect' window. The little 'x' at the top-right can be used to
return to the output window, and the left-arrow can be used to go back
to the properties of the previously inspected object.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">chineseBox</span>);</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><a name="exercise1"></a><div class="exercisenum">Ex. 4.1</div><div class="exercise"><p>The solution for the cat problem talks about a 'set' of names.

represent a set of names?</p><p>Show how a name can be added to this set, how one can be removed, and
how you can check whether a name occurs in it.</p></div><div class="solution"><p>This can be done by storing the content of the set as the properties
of an object. Adding a name is done by setting a property by that name
to a value, any value. Removing a name is done by deleting this

values discussed in <a href="chapter2.html">chapter 2</a> are all immutable, it is impossible to
change an existing value of those types. You can combine them and
derive new values from them, but when you take a specific string
value, the text inside it can not change. With objects, on the other
hand, the content of a value can be modified by changing its
properties.</p><p>When we have two numbers, <code>120</code> and <code>120</code>, they can for all practical
purposes be considered the precise same number. With objects, there is
a difference between having two references to the same object and
having two different objects that contain the same properties.
Consider the following code:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">object1</span> = {<span class="property">value</span>: <span class="atom">10</span>};
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">object2</span> = <span class="variable">object1</span>;
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">object3</span> = {<span class="property">value</span>: <span class="atom">10</span>};

<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">object1</span> == <span class="variable">object2</span>);
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">object1</span> == <span class="variable">object3</span>);

<span class="variable">object1</span>.<span class="property">value</span> = <span class="atom">15</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">object2</span>.<span class="property">value</span>);
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">object3</span>.<span class="property">value</span>);</pre><p><code>object1</code> and <code>object2</code> are two variables grasping the <em>same</em> value.
There is only one actual object, which is why changing <code>object1</code> also
changes the value of <code>object2</code>. The variable <code>object3</code> points to
another object, which initially contains the same properties as
<code>object1</code>, but lives a separate life.</p><p>JavaScript's <a name="key11"></a><code>==</code> operator, when comparing objects, will only return
<code>true</code> if both values given to it are the precise same value.
Comparing different objects with identical contents will give <code>false</code>.
This is useful in some situations, but impractical in others.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Object values can play a lot of different roles. Behaving like a set
is only one of those. We will see a few other roles in this chapter,
and <a href="chapter8.html">chapter 8</a> shows another important way of using objects.</p><p>In the plan for the cat problem ― in fact, call it an <em>algorithm</em>,
not a plan, that makes it sound like we know what we are talking about
― in the algorithm, it talks about going over all the e-mails in an
archive. What does this archive look like? And where does it come
from?</p><p>Do not worry about the second question for now. <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a> talks about
some ways to import data into your programs, but for now you will find
that the e-mails are just magically there. Some magic is really easy,
inside computers.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The way in which the archive is stored is still an interesting
question. It contains a number of e-mails. An e-mail can be a string,
that should be obvious. The whole archive could be put into one huge
string, but that is hardly practical. What we want is a collection of
separate strings.</p><p>Collections of things are what objects are used for. One could make an
object like this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">mailArchive</span> = {<span class="string">&quot;the first e-mail&quot;</span>: <span class="string">&quot;Dear nephew, ...&quot;</span>,
                   <span class="string">&quot;the second e-mail&quot;</span>: <span class="string">&quot;...&quot;</span>
                   <span class="comment">/* and so on ... */</span>};</pre><p>But that makes it hard to go over the e-mails from start to end ― how
does the program guess the name of these properties? This can be
solved by more predictable property names:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">mailArchive</span> = {<span class="atom">0</span>: <span class="string">&quot;Dear nephew, ... (mail number 1)&quot;</span>,
                   <span class="atom">1</span>: <span class="string">&quot;(mail number 2)&quot;</span>,

this kind of use. They are called <a name="key12"></a>arrays, and they provide some
conveniences, such as a <a name="key13"></a><code>length</code> property that contains the amount
of values in the array, and a number of operations useful for this
kind of collection.</p><p><a name="key14"></a>New arrays can be created using brackets (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>):</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">mailArchive</span> = [<span class="string">&quot;mail one&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;mail two&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;mail three&quot;</span>];

  <span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Processing e-mail #&quot;</span>, <span class="variable">current</span>, <span class="string">&quot;: &quot;</span>, <span class="variable">mailArchive</span>[<span class="variable">current</span>]);</pre><p>In this example, the numbers of the elements are not specified
explicitly anymore. The first one automatically gets the number 0, the
second the number 1, and so on.</p><p>Why start at 0? People tend to start counting from 1. As unintuitive
as it seems, numbering the elements in a collection from 0 is often
more practical. Just go with it for now, it will grow on you.</p><p>Starting at element 0 also means that in a collection with <code>X</code>
elements, the last element can be found at position <code>X - 1</code>. This is
why the <code>for</code> loop in the example checks for <code>current &lt;
mailArchive.length</code>. There is no element at position
<code>mailArchive.length</code>, so as soon as <code>current</code> has that value, we stop
looping.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><a name="exercise2"></a><div class="exercisenum">Ex. 4.2</div><div class="exercise"><p>Write a function <code>range</code> that takes one argument, a positive number,

been doing so far, it is now called simply <code>i</code>. Using single letters,
usually <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, or <code>k</code> for loop variables is a widely spread habit
among programmers. It has its origin mostly in laziness: We'd rather
type one character than seven, and names like <code>counter</code> and <code>current</code>
do not really clarify the meaning of the variable much.</p><p>If a program uses too many meaningless single-letter variables, it can
become unbelievably confusing. In my own programs, I try to only do
this in a few common cases. Small loops are one of these cases. If the
loop contains another loop, and that one also uses a variable named
<code>i</code>, the inner loop will modify the variable that the outer loop is
using, and everything will break. One could use <code>j</code> for the inner
loop, but in general, when the body of a loop is big, you should come
up with a variable name that has some clear meaning.</p></div></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Both string and array objects contain, in addition to the <code>length</code>

arguments, the function does somehow have access to the string

is described in <a href="chapter8.html">chapter 8</a>.</p><p>Properties that contain functions are generally called <a name="key17"></a>methods, as

this case, the string value itself can't help us much: JavaScript's
concept of text does not go any deeper than the 'sequence of

These are what most people use to split paragraphs. We consider a
paragraph, then, to be a part of an e-mail that starts at a newline
character or at the start of the content, and ends at the next newline
character or at the end of the content.</p><p>And we don't even have to write the algorithm for splitting a string
into paragraphs ourselves. Strings already have a method named
<a name="key21"></a><code>split</code>, which is (almost) the opposite of the <code>join</code> method of
arrays. It splits a string into an array, using the string given as
its argument to determine in which places to cut.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">words</span> = <span class="string">&quot;Cities of the Interior&quot;</span>;

character from a string. <code>x.charAt(0)</code> gives the first character, <code>1</code>
is the second one, and so on. One way to check whether a string starts
with &quot;born&quot; is:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">paragraph</span> = <span class="string">&quot;born 15-11-2003 (mother Spot): White Fang&quot;</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">paragraph</span>.<span class="property">charAt</span>(<span class="atom">0</span>) == <span class="string">&quot;b&quot;</span> &amp;&amp; <span class="variable">paragraph</span>.<span class="property">charAt</span>(<span class="atom">1</span>) == <span class="string">&quot;o&quot;</span> &amp;&amp;
     <span class="variable">paragraph</span>.<span class="property">charAt</span>(<span class="atom">2</span>) == <span class="string">&quot;r&quot;</span> &amp;&amp; <span class="variable">paragraph</span>.<span class="property">charAt</span>(<span class="atom">3</span>) == <span class="string">&quot;n&quot;</span>);</pre><p>But that gets a bit clumsy ― imagine checking for a word of ten
characters. There is something to be learned here though: when a line
gets ridiculously long, it can be spread over multiple lines. The
result can be made easier to read by lining up the start of the new
line with the first element on the original line that plays a similar
role.</p><p>Strings also have a method called <a name="key23"></a><code>slice</code>. It copies out a piece of
the string, starting from the character at the position given by the
first argument, and ending before (not including) the character at the
position given by the second one. This allows the check to be written
in a shorter way.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">paragraph</span>.<span class="property">slice</span>(<span class="atom">0</span>, <span class="atom">4</span>) == <span class="string">&quot;born&quot;</span>);</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><a name="exercise4"></a><div class="exercisenum">Ex. 4.4</div><div class="exercise"><p>Write a function called <code>startsWith</code> that takes two arguments, both

They could use the variable <code>livingCats</code> directly, if they wanted to.
The reason is that this way they are not completely tied to our

have to be called <code>addCatsToCatSet</code>, or something similar. The way it

one comprehensive complete reference for JavaScript. This is mostly
because its current form is the result of a chaotic process of
different browsers adding different extensions at different times. The
ECMA standard document that was mentioned in the introduction provides
a solid documentation of the basic language, but is more or less
unreadable. For most things, your best bet is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/">Mozilla Developer
Network</a>.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Maybe you already thought of a way to find out what is available in
the <code>Math</code> object:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">name</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> <span class="variable">Math</span>)
  <span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">name</span>);</pre><p>But alas, nothing appears. Similarly, when you do this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">name</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> [<span class="string">&quot;Huey&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;Dewey&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;Loui&quot;</span>])
  <span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">name</span>);</pre><p>You only see <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>2</code>, not <code>length</code>, or <code>push</code>, or <code>join</code>,
which are definitely also in there. Apparently, some properties of
objects are hidden<a name="key40"></a>. There is a good reason for
this: All objects have a few methods, for example <a name="key41"></a><code>toString</code>, which
converts the object into some kind of relevant string, and you do not
want to see those when you are, for example, looking for the cats that
you stored in the object.</p><p>Why the properties of <code>Math</code> are hidden is unclear to me. Someone
probably wanted it to be a mysterious kind of object.</p><p>All properties your programs add to objects are visible. There is no
way to make them hidden, which is unfortunate because, as we will see
in <a href="chapter8.html">chapter 8</a>, it would be nice to be able to add methods to objects
without having them show up in our <code>for</code>/<code>in</code> loops.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a name="key42"></a>Some properties are read-only, you can get
their value but not change it. For example, the properties of a string
value are all read-only.</p><p>Other properties can be 'active'. Changing them
causes <em>things</em> to happen. For example, lowering the length of an
array causes excess elements to be discarded:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">array</span> = [<span class="string">&quot;Heaven&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;Earth&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;Man&quot;</span>];
<span class="variable">array</span>.<span class="property">length</span> = <span class="atom">2</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">array</span>);</pre></div><ol class="footnotes"><li><a name="footnote1"></a>There are a few subtle problems with this approach, which will be
discussed and solved in <a href="chapter8.html">chapter 8</a>. For this chapter, it works well enough.</li></ol><div class="navigation"><a href="chapter3.html">&lt;&lt; Previous chapter</a> | <a href="contents.html">Contents</a> | <a href="index.html">Cover</a> | <a href="chapter5.html">Next chapter &gt;&gt;</a></div><div class="footer">© <a href="mailto:marijnh@gmail.com">Marijn Haverbeke</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">license</a>), written March to July 2007, last modified on April 4 2012.</div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="js/mochi.js"> </script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/codemirror.js"> </script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/ejs.js"> </script></body></html>
