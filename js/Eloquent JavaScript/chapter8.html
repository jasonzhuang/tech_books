stirred up the software industry. Most of the ideas behind it were not
really new at the time, but they had finally gained enough momentum to
start rolling, to become fashionable. Books were being written,
courses given, programming languages developed. All of a sudden,
everybody was extolling the virtues of object-orientation,
enthusiastically applying it to every problem, convincing themselves
they had finally found the <em>right way to write programs</em>.</p><p>These things happen a lot. When a process is hard and confusing,
people are always on the lookout for a magic solution. When something
looking like such a solution presents itself, they are prepared to
become devoted followers. For many programmers, even today,
object-orientation (or their view of it) is the gospel. When a program
is not 'truly object-oriented', whatever that means, it is considered
decidedly inferior.</p><p>Few fads have managed to stay popular for as long as this one, though.
Object-orientation's longevity can largely be explained by the fact
that the ideas at its core are very solid and useful. In this chapter,
we will discuss these ideas, along with JavaScript's (rather
eccentric) take on them. The above paragraphs are by no means meant to
discredit these ideas. What I want to do is warn the reader against
developing an unhealthy attachment to them.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>As the name suggests, object-oriented programming is related to
objects. So far, we have used objects as loose aggregations of values,
adding and altering their properties whenever we saw fit. In an
object-oriented approach, objects are viewed as little worlds of their
own, and the outside world may touch them only through a limited and
well-defined <a name="key2"></a>interface, a number of specific methods and properties.
The 'reached list' we used at the end of <a href="chapter7.html">chapter 7</a> is an example of
this: We used only three functions, <code>makeReachedList</code>, <code>storeReached</code>,
and <code>findReached</code> to interact with it. These three functions form an
interface for such objects.</p><p>The <code>Date</code>, <code>Error</code>, and <code>BinaryHeap</code> objects we have seen also work
like this. Instead of providing regular functions for working with the
objects, they provide a way to create such objects, using the <code>new</code>
keyword, and a number of methods and properties that provide the rest
of the interface.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>One way to give an object methods is to simply attach function values
to it.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">rabbit</span> = {};

For example, if there are different rabbits, the <code>speak</code> method must
indicate which rabbit is speaking. For this purpose, there is a
special variable called <a name="key3"></a><code>this</code>, which is always present when a
function is called, and which points at the relevant object when the
function is called as a method. A function is called as a method when
it is looked up as a property, and immediately called, as in
<code>object.method()</code>.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">speak</span>(<span class="variabledef">line</span>) {

method, for which we always used <code>null</code> in <a href="chapter6.html">chapter 6</a>. This argument can be
used to specify the object that the function must be applied to. For
non-method functions, this is irrelevant, hence the <code>null</code>.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">speak</span>.<span class="property">apply</span>(<span class="variable">fatRabbit</span>, [<span class="string">&quot;Yum.&quot;</span>]);</pre><p>Functions also have a <a name="key5"></a><code>call</code> method, which is similar to <code>apply</code>,
but you can give the arguments for the function separately instead of
as an array:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">speak</span>.<span class="property">call</span>(<span class="variable">fatRabbit</span>, <span class="string">&quot;Burp.&quot;</span>);</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The <a name="key6"></a><code>new</code> keyword provides a convenient way of creating new objects.
When a function is called with the word <code>new</code> in front of it, its
<a name="key7"></a><code>this</code> variable will point at a <em>new</em> object, which it will
automatically return (unless it explicitly returns something else).
Functions used to create new objects like this are called
<a name="key8"></a>constructors. Here is a constructor for rabbits:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">Rabbit</span>(<span class="variabledef">adjective</span>) {

<span class="variable">killerRabbit</span>.<span class="property">speak</span>(<span class="string">&quot;GRAAAAAAAAAH!&quot;</span>);</pre><p>It is a convention, among JavaScript programmers, to start the names
of constructors with a capital letter. This makes it easy to
distinguish them from other functions.</p><p>Why is the <code>new</code> keyword even necessary? After all, we could have
simply written this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">makeRabbit</span>(<span class="variabledef">adjective</span>) {
  <span class="keyword">return</span> {

<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">blackRabbit</span> = <span class="variable">makeRabbit</span>(<span class="string">&quot;black&quot;</span>);</pre><p>But that is not entirely the same. <code>new</code> does a few things behind the
scenes. For one thing, our <code>killerRabbit</code> has a property called
<a name="key9"></a><code>constructor</code>, which points at the <code>Rabbit</code> function that created
it. <code>blackRabbit</code> also has such a property, but it points at the
<a name="key10"></a><code>Object</code> function.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">killerRabbit</span>.<span class="property">constructor</span>);
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">blackRabbit</span>.<span class="property">constructor</span>);</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Where did the <code>constructor</code> property come from? It is part of the
<a name="key11"></a>prototype of a rabbit. Prototypes are a powerful, if somewhat
confusing, part of the way JavaScript objects work. Every object is
based on a prototype, which gives it a set of inherent properties. The
simple objects we have used so far are based on the most basic
prototype, which is associated with the <code>Object</code> constructor. In fact,
typing <code>{}</code> is equivalent to typing <code>new Object()</code>.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">simpleObject</span> = {};
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">simpleObject</span>.<span class="property">constructor</span>);
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">simpleObject</span>.<span class="property">toString</span>);</pre><p><a name="key12"></a><code>toString</code> is a method that is part of the <code>Object</code> prototype. This
means that all simple objects have a <code>toString</code> method, which converts
them to a string. Our rabbit objects are based on the prototype
associated with the <code>Rabbit</code> constructor. You can use a constructor's
<code>prototype</code> property to get access to, well, their prototype:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">Rabbit</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>);
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">Rabbit</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>.<span class="property">constructor</span>);</pre><p>Every function automatically gets a <code>prototype</code> property, whose
<code>constructor</code> property points back at the function. Because the rabbit
prototype is itself an object, it is based on the <code>Object</code> prototype,
and shares its <code>toString</code> method.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">killerRabbit</span>.<span class="property">toString</span> == <span class="variable">simpleObject</span>.<span class="property">toString</span>);</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Even though objects seem to share the properties of their prototype,
this sharing is one-way. The properties of the prototype influence the
object based on it, but the properties of this object never change the
prototype.</p><p>The precise rules are this: When looking up the value of a property,
JavaScript first looks at the properties that the object <em>itself</em> has.
If there is a property that has the name we are looking for, that is
the value we get. If there is no such property, it continues searching
the prototype of the object, and then the prototype of the prototype,
and so on. If no property is found, the value <code>undefined</code> is given. On
the other hand, when <em>setting</em> the value of a property, JavaScript
never goes to the prototype, but always sets the property in the
object itself.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">Rabbit</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>.<span class="property">teeth</span> = <span class="string">&quot;small&quot;</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">killerRabbit</span>.<span class="property">teeth</span>);

<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">Rabbit</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>.<span class="property">teeth</span>);</pre><p>This does mean that the prototype can be used at any time to add
new properties and methods to all objects based on it. For example, it
might become necessary for our rabbits to dance.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">Rabbit</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>.<span class="property">dance</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>() {

place for values that all rabbits have in common, such as the <code>speak</code>
method. Here is a new approach to the <code>Rabbit</code> constructor:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">Rabbit</span>(<span class="variabledef">adjective</span>) {

from this prototype can be tricky. It means that using an object to
store a set of things, such as the cats from <a href="chapter4.html">chapter 4</a>, can go wrong.
If, for example, we wondered whether there is a cat called
<code>&quot;constructor&quot;</code>, we would have checked it like this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">noCatsAtAll</span> = {};
<span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="string">&quot;constructor&quot;</span> in <span class="variable">noCatsAtAll</span>)
  <span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Yes, there definitely is a cat called 'constructor'.&quot;</span>);</pre><p>This is problematic. A related problem is that it can often be
practical to extend the prototypes of standard constructors such as
<code>Object</code> and <code>Array</code> with new useful functions. For example, we could
give all objects a method called <code>properties</code>, which returns an array
with the names of the (non-hidden) properties that the object has:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">Object</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>.<span class="property">properties</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
  <span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variabledef">result</span> = [];
  <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variabledef">property</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> <span class="localvariable">this</span>)
    <span class="localvariable">result</span>.<span class="property">push</span>(<span class="localvariable">property</span>);
  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="localvariable">result</span>;

<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">test</span> = {<span class="property">x</span>: <span class="atom">10</span>, <span class="property">y</span>: <span class="atom">3</span>};
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">test</span>.<span class="property">properties</span>());</pre><p>And that immediately shows the problem. Now that the <code>Object</code>
prototype has a property called <code>properties</code>, looping over the
properties of any object, using <code>for</code> and <a name="key13"></a><code>in</code>, will also give us
that shared property, which is generally not what we want. We are
interested only in the properties that the object itself has.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a way to find out whether a property belongs to
the object itself or to one of its prototypes. Unfortunately, it does
make looping over the properties of an object a bit clumsier. Every
object has a method called <a name="key14"></a><code>hasOwnProperty</code>, which tells us whether
the object has a property with a given name. Using this, we could
rewrite our <code>properties</code> method like this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">Object</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>.<span class="property">properties</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
  <span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variabledef">result</span> = [];

<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">test</span>.<span class="property">properties</span>());</pre><p><a name="key15"></a>And of course, we can abstract that into a higher-order
function. Note that the <code>action</code> function is called with both the name

It will be stored in the object, and the next time we want to go over
the collection of cats, calling <code>object.hasOwnProperty</code> will fail,
because that property no longer points at a function value. This can
be solved by doing something even uglier:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">forEachIn</span>(<span class="variabledef">object</span>, <span class="variabledef">action</span>) {

});</pre><p>(Note: This example does not currently work correctly in Internet
Explorer 8, which apparently has some problems with overriding
built-in prototype properties.)</p><p>Here, instead of using the method found in the object itself, we get
the method from the <code>Object</code> prototype, and then use <code>call</code> to apply
it to the right object. Unless someone actually messes with the method
in <code>Object.prototype</code> (don't do that), this should work correctly.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><code>hasOwnProperty</code> can also be used in those situations where we have
been using the <a name="key16"></a><code>in</code> operator to see whether an object has a specific
property. There is one more catch, however. We saw in <a href="chapter4.html">chapter 4</a> that
some properties, such as <code>toString</code>, are 'hidden', and do not show up
when going over properties with <code>for</code>/<code>in</code>. It turns out that browsers
in the Gecko family (Firefox, most importantly) give every object a
hidden property named <code>__proto__</code>, which points to the prototype of
that object. <code>hasOwnProperty</code> will return <code>true</code> for this one, even
though the program did not explicitly add it. Having access to the
prototype of an object can be very convenient, but making it a
property like that was not a very good idea. Still, Firefox is a
widely used browser, so when you write a program for the web you have
to be careful with this. There is a method <a name="key17"></a><code>propertyIsEnumerable</code>,
which returns <code>false</code> for hidden properties, and which can be used to
filter out strange things like <code>__proto__</code>. An expression such as this
one can be used to reliably work around this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">object</span> = {<span class="property">foo</span>: <span class="string">&quot;bar&quot;</span>};
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">Object</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>.<span class="property">hasOwnProperty</span>.<span class="property">call</span>(<span class="variable">object</span>, <span class="string">&quot;foo&quot;</span>) &amp;&amp;
     <span class="variable">Object</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>.<span class="property">propertyIsEnumerable</span>.<span class="property">call</span>(<span class="variable">object</span>, <span class="string">&quot;foo&quot;</span>));</pre><p>Nice and simple, no? This is one of the not-so-well-designed aspects
of JavaScript. Objects play both the role of 'values with methods',
for which prototypes work great, and 'sets of properties', for which
prototypes only get in the way.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Writing the above expression every time you need to check whether a
property is present in an object is unworkable. We could put it into a
function, but an even better approach is to write a constructor and a

});</pre><p>Now the whole mess related to approaching objects as plain sets of
properties has been 'encapsulated' in a convenient interface: one
constructor and four methods. Note that the <code>values</code> property of a
<code>Dictionary</code> object is not part of this interface, it is an internal
detail, and when you are using <code>Dictionary</code> objects you do not need to
directly use it.</p><p>Whenever you write an interface, it is a good idea to add a comment
with a quick sketch of what it does and how it should be used. This
way, when someone, possibly yourself three months after you wrote it,
wants to work with the interface, they can quickly see how to use it,
and do not have to study the whole program.</p><p>Most of the time, when you are designing an interface, you will soon
find some limitations and problems in whatever you came up with, and
change it. To prevent wasting your time, it is advisable to document
your interfaces only <em>after</em> they have been used in a few real
situations and proven themselves to be practical. ― Of course, this
might make it tempting to forget about documentation altogether.
Personally, I treat writing documentation as a 'finishing touch' to
add to a system. When it feels ready, it is time to write something
about it, and to see if it sounds as good in English (or whatever
language) as it does in JavaScript (or whatever programming language).</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The distinction between the external interface of an object and its
internal details is important for two reasons. Firstly, having a
small, clearly described interface makes an object easier to use. You
only have to keep the interface in mind, and do not have to worry
about the rest unless you are changing the object itself.</p><p>Secondly, it often turns out to be necessary or practical to change
something about the internal implementation of an object type<a class="footref" href="#footnote1">1</a>, to
make it more efficient, for example, or to fix some problem. When
outside code is accessing every single property and detail in the
object, you can not change any of them without also updating a lot of
other code. If outside code only uses a small interface, you can do
what you want, as long as you do not change the interface.</p><p>Some people go very far in this. They will, for example, never include
properties in the interface of object, only methods ― if their object
type has a length, it will be accessible with the <code>getLength</code> method,
not the <code>length</code> property. This way, if they ever want to change their
object in such a way that it no longer has a <code>length</code> property, for
example because it now has some internal array whose length it must
return, they can update the function without changing the interface.</p><p>My own take is that in most cases this is not worth it. Adding a
<code>getLength</code> method which only contains <code>return this.length;</code> mostly
just adds meaningless code, and, in most situations, I consider
meaningless code a bigger problem than the risk of having to
occasionally change the interface to my objects.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Adding new methods to existing prototypes can be very convenient.
Especially the <code>Array</code> and <code>String</code> prototypes in JavaScript could use
a few more basic methods. We could, for example, replace <code>forEach</code> and
<code>map</code> with methods on arrays, and make the <code>startsWith</code> function we
wrote in <a href="chapter4.html">chapter 4</a> a method on strings.</p><p>However, if your program has to run on the same web-page as another
program (either written by you or by someone else) which uses
<code>for</code>/<code>in</code> naively ― the way we have been using it so far ― then
adding things to prototypes, especially the <code>Object</code> and <code>Array</code>
prototype, will definitely break something, because these loops will
suddenly start seeing those new properties. For this reason, some
people prefer not to touch these prototypes at all. Of course, if you
are careful, and you do not expect your code to have to coexist with
badly-written code, adding methods to standard prototypes is a
perfectly good technique.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>In this chapter we are going to build a virtual terrarium, a tank with
insects moving around in it. There will be some objects involved (this
is, after all, the chapter on object-oriented programming). We will
take a rather simple approach, and make the terrarium a
two-dimensional grid, like the second map in <a href="chapter7.html">chapter 7</a>. On this grid
there are a number of bugs. When the terrarium is active, all the bugs
get a chance to take an action, such as moving, every half second.</p><p>Thus, we chop both time and space into units with a fixed size ―
squares for space, half seconds for time. This usually makes things
easier to model in a program, but of course has the drawback of being
wildly inaccurate. Fortunately, this terrarium-simulator is not
required to be accurate in any way, so we can get away with it.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>A terrarium can be defined with a 'plan', which is an array of
strings. We could have used a single string, but because JavaScript
strings must stay on a single line it would have been a lot harder to

(and the ornamental rocks lying in it), the <code>&quot;o&quot;</code>s represent bugs, and
the spaces are, as you might have guessed, empty space.</p><p>Such a plan-array can be used to create a terrarium-object. This
object keeps track of the shape and content of the terrarium, and lets
the bugs inside move. It has four methods: Firstly <code>toString</code>, which
converts the terrarium back to a string similar to the plan it was
based on, so that you can see what is going on inside it. Then there
is <code>step</code>, which allows all the bugs in the terrarium to move one
step, if they so desire. And finally, there are <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code>,
which control whether the terrarium is 'running'. When it is running,
<code>step</code> is automatically called every half second, so the bugs keep
moving.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><a name="exercise1"></a><div class="exercisenum">Ex. 8.1</div><div class="exercise"><p><a name="key19"></a>The points on the grid will be represented by objects again.

very clear which functionality goes where. Some things are best
written as methods of your objects, other things are better expressed
as separate functions, and some things are best implemented by adding
a new type of object. To keep things clear and organised, it is
important to keep the amount of methods and responsibilities that an
object type has as small as possible. When an object does too much, it
becomes a big mess of functionality, and a formidable source of
confusion.</p><p>I said above that the terrarium object will be responsible for storing
its contents and for letting the bugs inside it move. Firstly, note
that it <em>lets</em> them move, it doesn't <em>make</em> them move. The bugs
themselves will also be objects, and these objects are responsible for
deciding what they want to do. The terrarium merely provides the
infrastructure that asks them what to do every half second, and if
they decide to move, it makes sure this happens.</p><p>Storing the grid on which the content of the terrarium is kept can get
quite complex. It has to define some kind of representation, ways to
access this representation, a way to initialise the grid from a 'plan'
array, a way to write the content of the grid to a string for the
<code>toString</code> method, and the movement of the bugs on the grid. It would
be nice if part of this could be moved into another object, so that
the terrarium object itself doesn't get too big and complex.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Whenever you find yourself about to mix data representation and

the data representation code into a separate type of object. In this

which supports the operations that the terrarium will need.</p><p>To store the values on the grid, there are two options. One can use an

bug object has an <code>act</code> method which, when called, returns an
'action'. An action is an object with a <code>type</code> property, which names
the type of action the bug wants to take, for example <code>&quot;move&quot;</code>. For
most actions, the action also contains extra information, such as the
direction the bug wants to go.</p><p>Bugs are terribly myopic, they can only see the squares directly
around them on the grid. But these they can use to base their action
on. When the <code>act</code> method is called, it is given an object with
information about the surroundings of the bug in question. For each of
the eight directions, it contains a property. The property indicating
what is above the bug is called <code>&quot;n&quot;</code>, for North, the one
indicating what is above and to the right <code>&quot;ne&quot;</code>, for North-East, and

Anyway, when you are done watching this fascinating show, shut it
down:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">terrarium</span>.<span class="property">stop</span>();</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>We now have two kinds of objects that both have an <code>act</code> method and a
<code>character</code> property. Because they share these traits, the terrarium
can approach them in the same way. This allows us to have all kinds of
bugs, without changing anything about the terrarium code. This
technique is called <a name="key27"></a>polymorphism, and it is arguably the most
powerful aspect of object-oriented programming.</p><p>The basic idea of polymorphism is that when a piece of code is written
to work with objects that have a certain interface, any kind of object
that happens to support this interface can be plugged into the code,
and it will just work. We already saw simple examples of this, like
the <code>toString</code> method on objects. All objects that have a meaningful
<code>toString</code> method can be given to <code>print</code> and other functions that
need to convert values to strings, and the correct string will be
produced, no matter how their <code>toString</code> method chooses to build this
string.</p><p>Similarly, <code>forEach</code> works on both real arrays and the pseudo-arrays
found in the <code>arguments</code> variable, because all it needs is a <code>length</code>
property and properties called <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, and so on, for the elements
of the array.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>To make life in the terrarium more life-like, we will add to it the
concepts of food and reproduction. Each living thing in the terrarium
gets a new property, <code>energy</code>, which is reduced by performing actions,
and increased by eating things. When it has enough energy, a thing can
reproduce<a class="footref" href="#footnote2">2</a>, generating a new creature of the same kind.</p><p>If there are only bugs, wasting energy by moving around and eating
each other, a terrarium will soon succumb to the forces of entropy,
run out of energy, and become a lifeless wasteland. To prevent this
from happening (too quickly, at least), we add lichen to the
terrarium. Lichen do not move, they just use photo-synthesis to
gather energy, and reproduce.</p><p>To make this work, we will need a terrarium with a different
<code>processCreature</code> method. We could just replace the method of to the
<code>Terrarium</code> prototype, but we have become very attached to the
simulation of the bouncing and drunk bugs, and we would hate to break
our old terrarium.</p><p>What we can do is create a new constructor, <code>LifeLikeTerrarium</code>, whose
prototype is based on the <code>Terrarium</code> prototype, but which has a
different <code>processCreature</code> method.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>There are a few ways to do this. We could go over the properties of
<code>Terrarium.prototype</code>, and add them one by one to
<code>LifeLikeTerrarium.prototype</code>. This is easy to do, and in some cases
it is the best solution, but in this case there is a cleaner way. If
we make the old prototype object the prototype of the new prototype
object (you may have to re-read that a few times), it will
automatically have all its properties.</p><p><a name="key28"></a>Unfortunately, JavaScript does not have a straightforward
way to create an object whose prototype is a certain other object. It
is possible to write a function that does this, though, by using the
following trick:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">clone</span>(<span class="variabledef">object</span>) {
  <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variabledef">OneShotConstructor</span>(){}

  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="localvariable">OneShotConstructor</span>();
}</pre><p>This function uses an empty one-shot constructor, whose prototype is
the given object. When using <code>new</code> on this constructor, it will create
a new object based on the given object.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">LifeLikeTerrarium</span>(<span class="variabledef">plan</span>) {
  <span class="variable">Terrarium</span>.<span class="property">call</span>(<span class="localvariable">this</span>, <span class="localvariable">plan</span>);

<span class="variable">LifeLikeTerrarium</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>.<span class="property">constructor</span> = <span class="variable">LifeLikeTerrarium</span>;</pre><p>The new constructor doesn't need to do anything different from the old
one, so it just calls the old one on the <code>this</code> object. We also have
to restore the <code>constructor</code> property in the new prototype, or it
would claim its constructor is <code>Terrarium</code> (which, of course, is only
really a problem when we make use of this property, which we don't).</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>It is now possible to replace some of the methods of the
<code>LifeLikeTerrarium</code> object, or add new ones. We have based a new
object type on an old one, which saved us the work of re-writing all
the methods which are the same in <code>Terrarium</code> and <code>LifeLikeTerrarium</code>.
This technique is called '<a name="key29"></a>inheritance'. The new type inherits the
properties of the old type. In most cases, this means the new type
will still support the interface of the old type, though it might also
support a few methods that the old type does not have. This way,
objects of the new type can be (polymorphically) used in all the
places where objects of the old type could be used.</p><p>In most programming languages with explicit support for
object-oriented programming, inheritance is a very straightforward
thing. In JavaScript, the language doesn't really specify a simple way
to do it. Because of this, JavaScript programmers have invented many
different approaches to inheritance. Unfortunately, none of them is
quite perfect. Fortunately, such a broad range of approaches allows a
programmer to choose the most suitable one for the problem he is
solving, and allows certain tricks that would be utterly impossible in
other languages.</p><p>At the end of this chapter, I will show a few other ways to do
inheritance, and the issues they have.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Here is the new <code>processCreature</code> method.

Can you write a new

prevent these creatures from either going extinct right away or
gobbling up all lichen-eaters and then going extinct. The trick of
only eating when it spots two pieces of food doesn't work very well
for them, because their food moves around so much it is rare to find
two in one place. What does seem to help is making the eater-eater
really fat (high energy), so that it can survive times when
lichen-eaters are scarce, and only reproduces slowly, which prevents
it from exterminating its food source too quickly.</p><p>The lichen and eaters go through a periodic movement ― sometimes
lichen are abundant, which causes a lot of eaters to be born, which
causes the lichen to become scarce, which causes the eaters to starve,
which causes the lichen to become abundant, and so on. You could try
to make the lichen-eater-eaters 'hibernate' (use the <code>&quot;wait&quot;</code> action
for a while), when they fail to find food for a few turns. If you
choose the right amount of turns for this hibernation, or have them
wake up automatically when they smell lots of food, this could be a
good strategy.</p></div></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>That concludes our discussion of terraria. The rest of the chapter is
devoted to a more in-depth look at inheritance, and the problems
related to inheritance in JavaScript.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>First, some theory. Students of object-oriented programming can often
be heard having lengthy, subtle discussions about correct and
incorrect uses of inheritance. It is important to bear in mind that
inheritance, in the end, is just a trick that allows lazy<a class="footref" href="#footnote3">3</a>
programmers to write less code. Thus, the question of whether
inheritance is being used correctly boils down to the question of
whether the resulting code works correctly and avoids useless
repetitions. Still, the principles used by these students provide a
good way to start thinking about inheritance.</p><p>Inheritance is the creation of a new type of objects, the
'<a name="key30"></a>sub-type', based on an existing type, the '<a name="key31"></a>super-type'. The
sub-type starts with all the properties and methods of the super-type,
it inherits them, and then modifies a few of these, and optionally
adds new ones. Inheritance is best used when the thing modelled by the
sub-type can be said to <em>be</em> an object of the super-type.</p><p>Thus, a <code>Piano</code> type could be a sub-type of an <code>Instrument</code> type,
because a piano <em>is</em> an instrument. Because a piano has a whole array
of keys, one might be tempted to make <code>Piano</code> a sub-type of <code>Array</code>,
but a piano <em>is</em> no array, and implementing it like that is bound to
lead to all kinds of silliness. For example, a piano also has pedals.
Why would <code>piano[0]</code> give me the first key, and not the first pedal?
The situation is, of course, that a piano <em>has</em> keys, so it would be
better to give it a property <code>keys</code>, and possibly another property
<code>pedals</code>, both holding arrays.</p><p>It is possible for a sub-type to be the super-type of yet another
sub-type. Some problems are best solved by building a complex family
tree of types. You have to take care not to get too inheritance-happy,
though. Overuse of inheritance is a great way to make a program into a
big ugly mess.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The working of the <code>new</code> keyword and the <code>prototype</code> property of
constructors suggest a certain way of using objects. For simple
objects, such as the terrarium-creatures, this way works rather well.
Unfortunately, when a program starts to make serious use of
inheritance, this approach to objects quickly becomes clumsy. Adding
some functions to take care of common operations can make things a
little smoother. Many people define, for example, <code>inherit</code> and
<code>method</code> methods on objects.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">Object</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>.<span class="property">inherit</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="variabledef">baseConstructor</span>) {

you will come across scores of different variations on this, some of
them quite a lot more complex and clever than the above.</p><p>Note how the <code>push</code> method written here uses the <code>push</code> method from
the prototype of its parent type. This is something that is done often
when using inheritance ― a method in the sub-type internally uses a
method of the super-type, but extends it somehow.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The biggest problem with this basic approach is the duality between
constructors and prototypes. Constructors take a very central role,
they are the things that give an object type its name, and when you
need to get at a prototype, you have to go to the constructor and take
its <code>prototype</code> property.</p><p>Not only does this lead to a <em>lot</em> of typing (<code>&quot;prototype&quot;</code> is 9
letters), it is also confusing. We had to write an empty, useless
constructor for <code>StrangeArray</code> in the example above. Quite a few
times, I have found myself accidentally adding methods to a
constructor instead of its prototype, or trying to call <code>Array.slice</code>
when I really meant <code>Array.prototype.slice</code>. As far as I am concerned,
the prototype itself is the most important aspect of an object type,
and the constructor is just an extension of that, a special kind of
method.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>With a few simple helper methods added to <code>Object.prototype</code>, it is
possible to create an alternative approach to objects and inheritance.
In this approach, a type is represented by its prototype, and we will
use capitalised variables to store these prototypes. When it needs to
do any 'constructing' work, this is done by a method called
<code>construct</code>. We add a method called <code>create</code> to the <code>Object</code>
prototype, which is used in place of the <code>new</code> keyword. It clones the
object, and calls its <code>construct</code> method, if there is such a method,
giving it the arguments that were passed to <code>create</code>.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">Object</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>.<span class="property">create</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>() {

replacing some of its properties. We also provide a convenient
shorthand for this, an <code>extend</code> method, which clones the object it is
applied to and adds to this clone the properties in the object that it
is given as an argument.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">Object</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>.<span class="property">extend</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="variabledef">properties</span>) {

cause a problem.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>But don't let those complications discourage you from making use of
inheritance. Multiple inheritance, though extremely useful in some
situations, can be safely ignored most of the time. This is why
languages like Java get away with forbidding multiple inheritance. And
if, at some point, you find that you really need it, you can search
the web, do some research, and figure out an approach that works for
your situation.</p><p>Now that I think about it, JavaScript would probably be a great
environment for building a text adventure. The ability to change the
behaviour of objects at will, which is what prototypical inheritance
gives us, is very well suited for this. If you have an object
<code>hedgehog</code>, which has the unique habit of rolling up when it is
kicked, you can just change its <code>kick</code> method.</p><p>Unfortunately, the text adventure went the way of the vinyl record
and, while once very popular, is nowadays only played by a small
population of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.int-fiction/topics">enthusiasts</a>.</p></div><ol class="footnotes"><li><a name="footnote1"></a>Such types are usually called 'classes' in other programming
