be at least a little familiar with the World Wide Web. This
chapter contains a quick, superficial introduction to the various
elements that make the web work, and the way they relate to
JavaScript. The three after this one are more practical, and show some
of the ways JavaScript can be used to inspect and change a web-page.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The Internet is, basically, just a computer network spanning most of
the world. Computer networks make it possible for computers to send
each other messages. The techniques that underlie networking are an
interesting subject, but not the subject of this book. All you have to
know is that, typically, one computer, which we will call the
<a name="key1"></a>server, is waiting for other computers to start talking to it. Once
another computer, the <a name="key2"></a>client, opens communications with this server,
they will exchange whatever it is that needs to be exchanged using
some specific language, a <a name="key3"></a>protocol.</p><p>The Internet is used to carry messages for <em>many</em> different protocols.
There are protocols for chatting, protocols for file sharing,
protocols used by malicious software to control the computer of the
poor schmuck who installed it, and so on. The protocol that is of
interest to us is that used by the World Wide Web. It is called
<a name="key4"></a>HTTP, which stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, and is used to
retrieve web-pages and the files associated with them.</p><p>In HTTP communication, the server is the computer on which the
web-page is stored. The client is the computer, such as yours, which
asks the server for a page, so that it can display it. Asking for a
page like this is called an '<a name="key5"></a>HTTP request'.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Web-pages and other files that are accessible through the Internet are
identified by <a name="key6"></a>URLs, which is an abbreviation of Universal Resource
Locators. A URL looks like this:</p><pre class="preformatted">http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html</pre><p>It is composed of three parts. The start, <code>http://</code>, indicates that
this URL uses the HTTP protocol. There are some other protocols, such
as FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which also make use of URLs. The next
part, <code>acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu</code>, names the server on which this
page can be found. The end of the URL,
<code>/~phalsal/texts/taote-v3.html</code>, names a specific file on this server.</p><p>Most of the time, the World Wide Web is accessed using a browser.
After typing a URL or clicking a link, the browser makes the
appropriate HTTP request to the appropriate server. If all goes well,
the server responds by sending a file back to the browser, who shows
it to the user in one way or another.</p><p>When, as in the example, the retrieved file is an <a name="key7"></a>HTML document, it
will be displayed as a web-page. We briefly discussed HTML in <a href="chapter6.html">chapter 6</a>,
where we saw that it could refer to image files. In <a href="chapter9.html">chapter 9</a>, we
found that HTML pages can also contain <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to load files
of JavaScript code. When showing an HTML document, a browser will
fetch all these extra files from their servers, so it can add them to
the document.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Although a URL is supposed to point at a file, it is possible for a
web-server to do something more complicated than just looking up a
file and sending it to the client. ― It can process this file in some
way first, or maybe there is no file at all, but only a program that,
given an URL, has some way of generating the relevant document for it.</p><p>Programs that transform or generate documents on a server are a
popular way to make web-pages less static. When a file is just a file,
it is always the same, but when there is a program that builds it
every time it is requested, it could be made to look different for
each person, based on things like whether this person has logged in or
specified certain preferences. This can also make managing the content
of web-pages much easier ― instead of adding a new HTML file whenever
something new is put on a website, a new document is added to some
central storage, and the program knows where to find it and how to
show it to clients.</p><p>This kind of web programming is called <a name="key8"></a>server-side programming. It
affects the document before it is sent to the user. In some cases, it
is also practical to have a program that runs <em>after</em> the page has
been sent, when the user is looking at it. This is called <a name="key9"></a>client-side
programming, because the program runs on the client computer.
Client-side web programming is what JavaScript was invented for.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Running programs client-side has an inherent problem. You can never
really know in advance what kinds of programs the page you are
visiting is going to run. If it can send information from your
computer to others, damage something, or infiltrate your system,
surfing the web would be a rather hazardous activity.</p><p>To solve this dilemma, browsers severely limit the things a JavaScript
program may do. It is not allowed to look at your files, or to modify
anything not related to the web-page it came with. Isolating a
programming environment like this is called <a name="key10"></a>sand-boxing. Allowing
the programs enough room to be useful, and at the same time
restricting them enough to prevent them from doing harm is not an easy
thing to do. Every few months, some JavaScript programmer comes up
with a new way to circumvent the limitations and do something harmful
or privacy-invading. The people responsible for the browsers respond
by modifying their programs to make this trick impossible, and all is
well again ― until the next problem is discovered.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>One of the first JavaScript tricks that became widely used is the
<a name="key11"></a><a name="key12"></a><code>open</code> method of the <code>window</code> object. It takes a URL
as an argument, and will open a new window showing that URL.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">perry</span> = <span class="variable">window</span>.<span class="property">open</span>(<span class="string">&quot;http://www.pbfcomics.com&quot;</span>);</pre><p>Unless you turned off pop-up blocking in <a href="chapter6.html">chapter 6</a>, there's a chance that
this new window is blocked. There is a good reason pop-up blockers
exist. Web-programmers, especially those trying to get people to pay
attention to advertisements, have abused the poor <code>window.open</code> method
so much that by now, most users hate it with a passion. It has its
place though, and in this book we will be using it to show some
example pages. As a general rule, your scripts should not open any new
windows unless the user asked for them.</p><p>Note that, because <code>open</code> (just like <code>setTimeout</code> and company) is a
method on the <code>window</code> object, the <code>window.</code> part can be left off.
When a function is called 'normally', it is called as a method on the
top-level object, which is what <code>window</code> is. Personally, I think
<code>open</code> sounds a bit generic, so I'll usually type <code>window.open</code>, which
makes it clear that it is a window that is being opened.</p><p>The value returned by <code>window.open</code> is a new window. This is the
global object for the script running in that window, and contains all
the standard things like the <code>Object</code> constructor and the <code>Math</code>
object. But if you try to look at them, most browsers will (probably)
not let you...</p><pre class="code invalid"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">perry</span>.<span class="property">Math</span>);</pre><p>This is part of the sand-boxing that I mentioned earlier. Pages opened
by your browser might show information that is meant only for you, for
example on sites where you logged in, and thus it would be bad if any
random script could go and read them. The exception to this rule is
pages opened on the same domain: When a script running on a page from
<code>eloquentjavascript.net</code> opens another page on that same domain, it
can do everything it wants to this page.</p><p>An opened window can be closed with its <a name="key13"></a><a name="key14"></a><code>close</code>
method. If you didn't already close it yourself...</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">perry</span>.<span class="property">close</span>();</pre><p>Other kinds of sub-documents, such as frames
(documents-within-a-document), are also windows from the perspective
of a JavaScript program, and have their own JavaScript environment. In
fact, the environment that you have access to in the console belongs
to a small invisible frame hidden somewhere on this page ― this way,
it is slightly harder for you to accidentally mess up the whole page.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Every window object has a <a name="key15"></a><code>document</code> property, which contains an
object representing the document shown in that window. This object
contains, for example, a property <a name="key16"></a><code>location</code>,
with information about the URL of the document.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">document</span>.<span class="property">location</span>.<span class="property">href</span>);</pre><p>Setting <code>document.location.href</code> to a new URL can be used to make the
browser load another document. Another application of the <code>document</code>
object is its <a name="key17"></a><code>write</code> method. This method, when
given a string argument, writes some HTML to the document. When it is
used on a fully loaded document, it will replace the whole document by
the given HTML, which is usually not what you want. The idea is to
have a script call it while the document is being loaded, in which
case the written HTML will be inserted into the document at the place
of the <code>script</code> tag that triggered it. This is a simple way to add
some dynamic elements to a page. For example, here is a trivially
simple document showing the current time.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">timeWriter</span>);
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">time</span> = <span class="variable">viewHTML</span>(<span class="variable">timeWriter</span>);</pre><pre class="code"><span class="variable">time</span>.<span class="property">close</span>();</pre><p>Often, the techniques shown in <a href="chapter12.html">chapter 12</a> provide a cleaner and more
versatile way to modify the document, but occasionally,
<code>document.write</code> is the nicest, simplest way to do something.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Another popular application of JavaScript in web pages centers around
<a name="key18"></a>forms. In case you are not quite sure what the role of 'forms' is,
let me give a quick summary.</p><p>A basic HTTP request is a simple request for a file. When this file is
not really a passive file, but a server-side program, it can become
useful to include information other than a filename in the request.
For this purpose, HTTP requests are allowed to contain additional
'parameters'. Here is an example:</p><pre class="preformatted">http://www.google.com/search?q=aztec%20empire</pre><p>After the filename (<code>/search</code>), the URL continues with a question
mark, after which the parameters follow. This request has one
parameter, called <code>q</code> (for 'query', presumably), whose value is <code>aztec
empire</code>. The <code>%20</code> part corresponds to a space. There are a number of
characters that can not occur in these values, such as spaces,
ampersands, or question marks. These are 'escaped' by replacing them
with a <code>%</code> followed by their numerical value<a class="footref" href="#footnote1">1</a>, which serves the same
purpose as the backslashes used in strings and regular expressions,
but is even more unreadable.</p><p>JavaScript provides functions <a name="key19"></a><code>encodeURIComponent</code> and
<a name="key20"></a><code>decodeURIComponent</code> to add these codes to strings and remove them
again.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">encoded</span> = <span class="variable">encodeURIComponent</span>(<span class="string">&quot;aztec empire&quot;</span>);
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">encoded</span>);
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">decodeURIComponent</span>(<span class="variable">encoded</span>));</pre><p>When a request contains more than one parameter, they are separated by
ampersands, as in...</p><pre class="preformatted">http://www.google.com/search?q=aztec%20empire&amp;lang=nl</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>A form, basically, is a way to make it easy for browser-users to
create such parameterised URLs. It contains a number of fields, such
as input boxes for text, checkboxes that can be 'checked' and
'unchecked', or thingies that allow you to choose from a given set of
values. It also usually contains a 'submit' button and, invisible to
the user, an 'action' URL to which it should be sent. When the submit
button is clicked, or enter is pressed, the information that was
entered in the fields is added to this action URL as parameters, and
the browser will request this URL.</p><p>Here is the HTML for a simple form:</p><pre class="preformatted">&lt;form name=&quot;userinfo&quot; method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;info.html&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Please give us your information, so that we can send
  you spam.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Name: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;E-Mail: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;email&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sex: &lt;select name=&quot;sex&quot;&gt;
            &lt;option&gt;Male&lt;/option&gt;
            &lt;option&gt;Female&lt;/option&gt;
            &lt;option&gt;Other&lt;/option&gt;
          &lt;/select&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;send&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Send!&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre><p>The name of the form can be used to access it with JavaScript, as we
shall see in a moment. The names of the fields determine the names of
the HTTP parameters that are used to store their values. Sending this
form might produce a URL like this:</p><pre class="preformatted">http://planetspam.com/info.html?name=Ted&amp;email=ted@zork.com&amp;sex=Male</pre><p>There are quite a few other tags and properties that can be used in
forms, but in this book we will stick with simple ones, so that we can
concentrate on JavaScript.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The <code>method=&quot;get&quot;</code> property of the example form shown above indicates
that this form should encode the values it is given as URL parameters,
as shown before. There is an alternative method for sending
parameters, which is called <code>post</code>. An HTTP request using the <code>post</code>
method contains, in addition to a URL, a block of data. A form using
the <code>post</code> method puts the values of its parameters in this data block
instead of in the URL.</p><p>When sending big chunks of data, the <code>get</code> method will result in URLs
that are a mile wide, so <code>post</code> is usually more convenient. But the
difference between the two methods is not just a question of
convenience. Traditionally, <code>get</code> requests are used for requests that
just ask the server for some document, while <code>post</code> requests are used
to take an action that changes something on the server. For example,
getting a list of recent messages on an Internet forum would be a
<code>get</code> request, while adding a new message would be a <code>post</code> request.
There is a good reason why most pages follow this distinction ―
programs that automatically explore the web, such as those used by
search engines, will generally only make <code>get</code> requests. If changes to
a site can be made by <code>get</code> requests, these well-meaning 'crawlers'
could do all kinds of damage.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>When the browser is displaying a page containing a form, JavaScript
programs can inspect and modify the values that are entered in the
form's fields. This opens up possibilities for all kinds of tricks,
such as checking values before they are sent to the server, or
automatically filling in certain fields.</p><p>The form shown above can be found in the file <code>example_getinfo.html</code>.
Open it.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">form</span> = <span class="variable">window</span>.<span class="property">open</span>(<span class="string">&quot;example_getinfo.html&quot;</span>);</pre><p>When a URL does not contain a server name, it is called a <a name="key21"></a>relative URL.
Relative URLs are interpreted by the browser to refer to files on the
same server as the current document. Unless they start with a slash,
the path (or directory) of the current document is also retained, and
the given path is appended to it.</p><p>We will be adding a validity check to the form, so that it only
submits if the name field is not left empty and the e-mail field
contains something that looks like a valid e-mail address. Because we
no longer want the form to submit immediately when the 'Send!' button
is pressed, its <code>type</code> property has been changed from <code>&quot;submit&quot;</code> to
<code>&quot;button&quot;</code>, which turns it into a regular button with no effect. ―
<a href="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a> will show a <em>much</em> better way of doing this, but for now, we
use the naive method.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a name="key22"></a>To be able to work with the newly opened window (if you
closed it, re-open it first), we 'attach' the console to it, like
this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">attach</span>(<span class="variable">form</span>);</pre><p>After doing this, the code run from the console will be run in the
given window. To verify that we are indeed working with the correct
window, we can look at the document's <code>location</code> and <code>title</code>
properties.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">document</span>.<span class="property">location</span>.<span class="property">href</span>);
<span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">document</span>.<span class="property">title</span>);</pre><p>Because we have entered a new environment, previously defined
variables, such as <code>form</code>, are no longer present.</p><pre class="code invalid"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">form</span>);</pre><p><a name="key23"></a>To get back to our starting environment, we can use the
<code>detach</code> function (without arguments). But first, we have to add that
validation system to the form.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Every HTML tag shown in a document has a JavaScript object associated
with it. These objects can be used to inspect and manipulate almost
every aspect of the document. In this chapter, we will work with the
objects for forms and form fields, <a href="chapter12.html">chapter 12</a> talks about these objects in
more detail.</p><p><a name="key24"></a>The <code>document</code> object has a property named <code>forms</code>,
which contains links to all the forms in the document, by name. Our
form has a property <code>name=&quot;userinfo&quot;</code>, so it can be found under the
property <code>userinfo</code>.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">userForm</span> = <span class="variable">document</span>.<span class="property">forms</span>.<span class="property">userinfo</span>;

<span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">userForm</span>.<span class="property">action</span>);</pre><p>In this case, the properties <code>method</code> and <code>action</code> that were given to
the HTML <code>form</code> tag are also present as properties of the JavaScript
object. This is often the case, but not always: Some HTML properties
are spelled differently in JavaScript, others are not present at all.
<a href="chapter12.html">Chapter 12</a> will show a way to get at all properties.</p><p>The object for the <code>form</code> tag has a property <code>elements</code>, which refers
to an object containing the fields of the form, by name.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">nameField</span> = <span class="variable">userForm</span>.<span class="property">elements</span>.<span class="property">name</span>;

pages also automatically make the cursor jump to the next field when
it looks like you finished filling in one field ― for example, when
you type a zip code. This should not be overdone ― it makes the page
behave in a way the user does not expect. If he is used to pressing

web programming is no walk in the park. It can, at times, be a very
painful ordeal. Why? Because programs that are supposed to run on the
client computer generally have to work for all popular browsers. Each
of these browsers tends to work slightly different. To make things
worse, each of them contains a unique set of problems. Do not assume
that a program is bug-free just because it was made by a multi-billion
dollar company. So it is up to us, the web-programmer, to rigorously
test our programs, figure out what goes wrong, and find ways to work
around it.</p><p>Some of you might think &quot;I will just report any problems/<a name="key28"></a>bugs I find
to the browser manufacturers, and they will certainly solve fix them
immediately&quot;. These people are in for a major disappointment. The most
recent version of Internet Explorer, the browser that is still used by
some seventy percent of web-surfers (and that every web-developer
likes to rag on) still contains bugs that have been known for over
five years. Serious bugs, too.</p><p>But do not let that discourage you. With the right kind of
obsessive-compulsive mindset, such problems provide wonderful
challenges. And for those of us who do not like wasting our time,
being careful and avoiding the obscure corners of the browser's
functionality will generally prevent you from running into too much
trouble.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Bugs aside, the by-design differences in interface between browsers
still make for an interesting challenge. The current situation looks
something like this: On the one hand, there are all the 'small'
browsers: Firefox, Safari, and Opera are the most important ones, but
there are more. These browsers all make a reasonable effort to adhere
to a set of standards that have been developed, or are being
developed, by the W3C, an organisation that tries to make the Web a
less confusing place by defining standard interfaces for things like
this. On the other hand, there is Internet Explorer, Microsoft's
browser, which rose to dominance in a time when many of these
standards did not really exist yet, and hasn't made much effort to
adjust itself to what other people are doing.</p><p>In some areas, such as the way the content of an HTML document can be
approached from JavaScript (<a href="chapter12.html">chapter 12</a>), the standards are based on the
method that Internet Explorer invented, and things work more or less
the same on all browsers. In other areas, such as the way events
(mouse-clicks, key-presses, and such) are handled (<a href="chapter13.html">chapter 13</a>), Internet
Explorer works radically different from other browsers.</p><p>For a long time, owing partially to the cluelessness of the average
JavaScript developer, and partially to the fact that browser
incompatibilities were much worse when browsers like Internet Explorer
version 4 or 5 and old versions of Netscape were still common, the
usual way to deal with such differences was to detect which browser
the user was running, and litter code with alternate solutions for
each browser ― if this is Internet Explorer, do this, if this is
Netscape, do that, and if this is other browser that we didn't think
of, just hope for the best. You can imagine how hideous, confusing,
and long such programs were.</p><p>Many sites would also just refuse to load when opened in a browser
that was 'not supported'. This caused a few of the minor browsers to
swallow their pride and pretend they were Internet Explorer, just so
they would be allowed to load such pages. The properties of the
<a name="key29"></a><code>navigator</code> object contain information about the browser that a page
was loaded in, but because of such lying this information is not
particularly reliable. See what yours says<a class="footref" href="#footnote2">2</a>:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">forEachIn</span>(<span class="variable">navigator</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="variabledef">name</span>, <span class="variabledef">value</span>) {
  <span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="localvariable">name</span>, <span class="string">&quot; = &quot;</span>, <span class="localvariable">value</span>);
});</pre><p>A better approach is to try and 'isolate' our programs from
differences in browsers. If you need, for example, to find out more
about an event, such as the clicks we handled by setting the <code>onclick</code>
property of our send button, you have to look at the top-level object
called <code>event</code> on Internet Explorer, but you have to use the first
argument passed to the event-handling function on other browsers. To
handle this, and a number of other differences related to events, one
can write a helper function for attaching events to things, which
takes care of all the plumbing and allows the event-handling functions
themselves to be the same for all browsers. In <a href="chapter13.html">chapter 13</a> we will write
such a function.</p><p>(Note: The browser quirks mentioned in the following chapters refer to
the state of affairs in early 2007, and might no longer be accurate on
some points.)</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>These chapters will only give a somewhat superficial introduction to
the subject of browser interfaces. They are not the main subject of
this book, and they are complex enough to fill a thick book on their
own. When you understand the basics of these interfaces (and
understand something about HTML), it is not too hard to look for
specific information online. The interface documentation for the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko_DOM_Reference">Firefox</a>
and <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/yek4tbz0.aspx">Internet Explorer</a> browsers are a good
place to start.</p><p>The information in the next chapters will not deal with the quirks of
'previous-generation' browsers. They deal with Internet Explorer 6,
Firefox 1.5, Opera 9, Safari 3, or any more recent versions of the
same browsers. Most of it will also probably be relevant to modern but
obscure browsers such as Konqueror, but this has not been extensively
checked. Fortunately, these previous-generation browsers have pretty
much died out, and are hardly used anymore.</p><p>There is, however, a group of web-users that will still use a browser
without JavaScript. A large part of this group consists of people
using a regular graphical browser, but with JavaScript disabled for
security reasons. Then there are people using textual browsers, or
browsers for blind people. When working on a 'serious' site, it is
often a good idea to start with a plain HTML system that works, and
then add non-essential tricks and conveniences with JavaScript.</p></div><ol class="footnotes"><li><a name="footnote1"></a>The value a character gets is decided by the ASCII standard, which
