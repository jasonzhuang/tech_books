patterns in string values. In <a href="chapter4.html">chapter 4</a> we extracted date values from
strings by writing out the precise positions at which the numbers that
were part of the date could be found. Later, in <a href="chapter6.html">chapter 6</a>, we saw some
particularly ugly pieces of code for finding certain types of
characters in a string, for example the characters that had to be
escaped in HTML output.</p><p><a name="key1"></a>Regular expressions are a language for describing
patterns in strings. They form a small, separate language, which is
embedded inside JavaScript (and in various other programming
languages, in one way or another). It is not a very readable language
― big regular expressions tend to be completely unreadable. But, it
is a useful tool, and can really simplify string-processing programs.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Just like strings get written between quotes, regular expression
patterns get written between slashes (<a name="key2"></a><code>/</code>). This means that slashes
inside the expression have to be escaped.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">slash</span> = <span class="string">/\//</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="string">&quot;AC/DC&quot;</span>.<span class="property">search</span>(<span class="variable">slash</span>));</pre><p>The <a name="key3"></a><code>search</code> method resembles <code>indexOf</code>, but it searches for a
regular expression instead of a string. Patterns specified by regular
expressions can do a few things that strings can not do. For a start,
they allow some of their elements to match more than a single
character. In <a href="chapter6.html">chapter 6</a>, when extracting mark-up from a document, we
needed to find the first asterisk or opening brace in a string. That
could be done like this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">asteriskOrBrace</span> = <span class="string">/[\{\*]/</span>;
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">story</span> =
  <span class="string">&quot;We noticed the *giant sloth*, hanging from a giant branch.&quot;</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">story</span>.<span class="property">search</span>(<span class="variable">asteriskOrBrace</span>));</pre><p>The <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> characters have a special meaning inside a regular
expression. They can enclose a set of characters, and they mean 'any
of these characters'. Most non-alphanumeric characters have some
special meaning inside a regular expression, so it is a good idea to
always escape them with a backslash<a class="footref" href="#footnote1">1</a> when you use them to refer to
the actual characters.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>There are a few shortcuts for sets of characters that are needed
often. The dot (<code>.</code>) can be used to mean 'any character that is not a
newline', an escaped 'd' (<code>\d</code>) means 'any digit', an escaped 'w'
(<code>\w</code>) matches any alphanumeric character (including underscores, for
some reason), and an escaped 's' (<code>\s</code>) matches any white-space (tab,
newline, space) character.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">digitSurroundedBySpace</span> = <span class="string">/\s\d\s/</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="string">&quot;1a 2 3d&quot;</span>.<span class="property">search</span>(<span class="variable">digitSurroundedBySpace</span>));</pre><p>The escaped 'd', 'w', and 's' can be replaced by their capital letter
to mean their opposite. For example, <code>\S</code> matches any character that
is <em>not</em> white-space. When using <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>, a pattern can be
inverted by starting with a <code>^</code> character:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">notABC</span> = <span class="string">/[^ABC]/</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="string">&quot;ABCBACCBBADABC&quot;</span>.<span class="property">search</span>(<span class="variable">notABC</span>));</pre><p>As you can see, the way regular expressions use characters to express
patterns makes them A) very short, and B) very hard to read.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><a name="exercise1"></a><div class="exercisenum">Ex. 10.1</div><div class="exercise"><p>Write a regular expression that matches a date in the format

Putting an asterisk (<code>*</code>) after an element allows it to be repeated
any number of times, including zero. A plus (<code>+</code>) does the same, but
requires the pattern to occur at least one time. A question mark (<code>?</code>)
makes an element 'optional' ― it can occur zero or one times.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">parenthesizedText</span> = <span class="string">/\(.*\)/</span>;

of times an element may occur. A number between braces (<code>{4}</code>) gives
the exact amount of times it must occur. Two numbers with a comma
between them (<code>{3,10}</code>) indicate that the pattern must occur at least
as often as the first number, and at most as often as the second one.
Similarly, <code>{2,}</code> means two or more occurrences, while <code>{,4}</code> means
four or less.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">datePattern</span> = <span class="string">/\d{1,2}\/\d\d?\/\d{4}/</span>;

This allows us to use <code>*</code> and such on more than one character. For
example:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">cartoonCrying</span> = <span class="string">/boo(hoo+)+/i</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Then, he exclaimed 'Boohoooohoohooo'&quot;</span>.<span class="property">search</span>(<span class="variable">cartoonCrying</span>));</pre><p>Where did the <code>i</code> at the end of that regular expression come from?
After the closing slash, 'options' may be added to a regular
expression. An <code>i</code>, here, means the expression is case-insensitive,
which allows the lower-case B in the pattern to match the upper-case
one in the string.</p><p>A pipe character (<code>|</code>) is used to allow a pattern to make a choice
between two elements. For example:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">holyCow</span> = <span class="string">/(sacred|holy) (cow|bovine|bull|taurus)/i</span>;
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">holyCow</span>.<span class="property">test</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Sacred bovine!&quot;</span>));</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Often, looking for a pattern is just a first step in extracting
something from a string. In previous chapters, this extraction was
done by calling a string's <code>indexOf</code> and <code>slice</code> methods a lot. Now
that we are aware of the existence of regular expressions, we can use
the <code>match</code> method instead. When a string is matched against a regular
expression, the result will be <code>null</code> if the match failed, or an array
of matched strings if it succeeded.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="string">&quot;No&quot;</span>.<span class="property">match</span>(<span class="string">/Yes/</span>));

string that matched the pattern. As the last example shows, when there
are parenthesized parts in the pattern, the parts they match are also
added to the array. Often, this makes extracting pieces of string very
easy.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">parenthesized</span> = <span class="variable">prompt</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Tell me something&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;&quot;</span>).<span class="property">match</span>(<span class="string">/\((.*)\)/</span>);

out whether the numbers had one or two digits, and whether the dashes
were in the right places.</p></div></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>The <a name="key5"></a><code>replace</code> method of string values, which we saw in <a href="chapter6.html">chapter 6</a>, can be

example, we have a big string containing the names of people, one name
per line, in the format &quot;Lastname, Firstname&quot;. We want to swap these
names, and remove the comma, to get a simple &quot;Firstname Lastname&quot;
format.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">names</span> = <span class="string">&quot;Picasso, Pablo\nGauguin, Paul\nVan Gogh, Vincent&quot;</span>;

up to <code>$9</code>.</p><p>If you have more than 9 parentheses parts in your pattern, this will
no longer work. But there is one more way to replace pieces of a
string, which can also be useful in some other tricky situations. When
the second argument given to the <code>replace</code> method is a function value
instead of a string, this function is called every time a match is
found, and the matched text is replaced by whatever the function
returns. The arguments given to the function are the matched elements,
similar to the values found in the arrays returned by <code>match</code>: The
first one is the whole match, and after that comes one argument for
