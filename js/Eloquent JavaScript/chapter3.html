Repeating all the necessary statements every time is tedious and
error-prone. It would be better to put them in one place, and have the
program take a detour through there whenever necessary. This is what
<a name="key1"></a>functions were invented for: They are canned code that a program can
go through whenever it wants. Putting a string on the screen requires
quite a few statements, but when we have a <code>print</code> function we can
just write <code>print(&quot;Aleph&quot;)</code> and be done with it.</p><p>To view functions merely as canned chunks of code doesn't do them
justice though. When needed, they can play the role of pure functions,
algorithms, indirections, abstractions, decisions, modules,
continuations, data structures, and more. Being able to effectively
use functions is a necessary skill for any kind of serious
programming. This chapter provides an introduction into the subject,
<a href="chapter6.html">chapter 6</a> discusses the subtleties of functions in more depth.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a name="key2"></a>Pure functions, for a start, are the things that were
called functions in the mathematics classes that I hope you have been
subjected to at some point in your life. Taking the cosine or the
absolute value of a number is a pure function of one argument.
Addition is a pure function of two arguments.</p><p>The defining properties of pure functions are that they always return
the same value when given the same arguments, and never have side
effects. They take some arguments, return a value based on these
arguments, and do not monkey around with anything else.</p><p>In JavaScript, addition is an operator, but it could be wrapped in a
function like this (and as pointless as this looks, we will come
across situations where it is actually useful):</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">add</span>(<span class="variabledef">a</span>, <span class="variabledef">b</span>) {

two arguments. <code>return a + b;</code> is the body of the function.</p><p>The keyword <a name="key3"></a><code>function</code> is always used when creating a new function.
When it is followed by a variable name, the resulting function will be
stored under this name. After the name comes a list of <a name="key4"></a>argument
names, and then finally the <a name="key5"></a>body of the function. Unlike those
around the body of <code>while</code> loops or <code>if</code> statements, the braces around
a function body are obligatory<a class="footref" href="#footnote1">1</a>.</p><p>The keyword <a name="key6"></a><code>return</code>, followed by an expression, is used to
determine the value the function returns. When control comes across a
<code>return</code> statement, it immediately jumps out of the current function
and gives the returned value to the code that called the function. A
<code>return</code> statement without an expression after it will cause the
function to return <code>undefined</code>.</p><p>A body can, of course, have more than one statement in it. Here is a

look familiar.</p><p>Creating a variable (<code>result</code>) and updating it are side effects.
Didn't I just say pure functions had no side effects?</p><p>A variable created inside a function exists only inside the function.
This is fortunate, or a programmer would have to come up with a
different name for every variable he needs throughout a program.
Because <code>result</code> only exists inside <code>power</code>, the changes to it only
last until the function returns, and from the perspective of code that
calls it there are no side effects.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><a name="exercise1"></a><div class="exercisenum">Ex. 3.1</div><div class="exercise"><p>Write a function called <code>absolute</code>, which returns the absolute value

about, and they are easy to re-use.</p><p>If a function is pure, a call to it can be seen as a thing in itself.
When you are not sure that it is working correctly, you can test it by
calling it directly from the console, which is simple because it does
not depend on any context<a class="footref" href="#footnote2">2</a>. It is easy to make these tests automatic
― to write a program that tests a specific function. Non-pure
functions might return different values based on all kinds of factors,
and have side effects that might be hard to test and think about.</p><p>Because pure functions are self-sufficient, they are likely to be
useful and relevant in a wider range of situations than non-pure ones.
Take <code>show</code>, for example. This function's usefulness depends on the
presence of a special place on the screen for printing output. If that
place is not there, the function is useless. We can imagine a related
function, let's call it <code>format</code>, that takes a value as an argument
and returns a string that represents this value. This function is
useful in more situations than <code>show</code>.</p><p>Of course, <code>format</code> does not solve the same problem as <code>show</code>, and no
pure function is going to be able to solve that problem, because it
requires a side effect. In many cases, non-pure functions are
precisely what you need. In other cases, a problem can be solved with
a pure function but the non-pure variant is much more convenient or
efficient.</p><p>Thus, when something can easily be expressed as a pure function, write
it that way. But never feel dirty for writing non-pure functions.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Functions with side effects do not have to contain a <code>return</code>

program a variable will be available by looking at the shape of the
program text, lexical scoping also allows us to 'synthesise'
functions. By using some of the variables from an enclosing function,
an inner function can be made to do different things. Imagine we need
a few different but similar functions, one that adds 2 to its
argument, one that adds 5, and so on.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">makeAddFunction</span>(<span class="variabledef">amount</span>) {

just package up a computation, but also an environment. Top-level
functions simply execute in the top-level environment, that much is
obvious. But a function defined inside another function retains access
to the environment that existed in that function at the point when it
was defined.</p><p>Thus, the <code>add</code> function in the above example, which is created when
<code>makeAddFunction</code> is called, captures an environment in which <code>amount</code>
has a certain value. It packages this environment, together with the
computation <code>return number + amount</code>, into a value, which is then
returned from the outer function.</p><p>When this returned function (<code>addTwo</code> or <code>addFive</code>) is called, a new
environment―-in which the variable <code>number</code> has a value―-is created,
as a sub-environment of the captured environment (in which <code>amount</code>
has a value). These two values are then added, and the result is
returned.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>On top of the fact that different functions can contain variables of
the same name without getting tangled up, these scoping rules also
allow functions to call <em>themselves</em> without running into problems. A
function that calls itself is called recursive. <a name="key13"></a>Recursion
allows for some interesting definitions. Look at this implementation
of <code>power</code>:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">power</span>(<span class="variabledef">base</span>, <span class="variabledef">exponent</span>) {

and to me it looks a lot nicer than the earlier version. It sort of
loops, but there is no <code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, or even a local side effect to
be seen. By calling itself, the function produces the same effect.</p><p>There is one important problem though: In most browsers, this second
version is about ten times slower than the first one. In JavaScript,
running through a simple loop is a lot cheaper than calling a
function multiple times.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a name="key14"></a>The dilemma of speed versus <a name="key15"></a>elegance is an interesting
one. It not only occurs when deciding for or against recursion. In
many situations, an elegant, intuitive, and often short solution can
be replaced by a more convoluted but faster solution.</p><p>In the case of the <code>power</code> function above the un-elegant version is
still sufficiently simple and easy to read. It doesn't make very much
sense to replace it with the recursive version. Often, though, the
concepts a program is dealing with get so complex that giving up some
efficiency in order to make the program more straightforward becomes
an attractive choice.</p><p>The basic rule, which has been repeated by many programmers and with
which I wholeheartedly agree, is to not worry about efficiency until
your program is provably too slow. When it is, find out which parts
are too slow, and start exchanging elegance for efficiency in those
parts.</p><p>Of course, the above rule doesn't mean one should start ignoring
performance altogether. In many cases, like the <code>power</code> function, not
much simplicity is gained by the 'elegant' approach. In other cases,
an experienced programmer can see right away that a simple approach is
never going to be fast enough.</p><p>The reason I am making a big deal out of this is that surprisingly
many programmers focus fanatically on efficiency, even in the smallest
details. The result is bigger, more complicated, and often less
correct programs, which take longer to write than their more
straightforward equivalents and often run only marginally faster.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>But I was talking about recursion. A concept closely related to
recursion is a thing called the <a name="key16"></a>stack. When a function is called,
control is given to the body of that function. When that body returns,
the code that called the function is resumed. While the body is
running, the computer must remember the context from which the
function was called, so that it knows where to continue afterwards.
The place where this context is stored is called the stack.</p><p>The fact that it is called 'stack' has to do with the fact that, as we
saw, a function body can again call a function. Every time a function
is called, another context has to be stored. One can visualise this as
a stack of contexts. Every time a function is called, the current
context is thrown on top of the stack. When a function returns, the
context on top is taken off the stack and resumed.</p><p>This stack requires space in the computer's memory to be stored. When
the stack grows too big, the computer will give up with a message like
&quot;out of stack space&quot; or &quot;too much recursion&quot;. This is something that
has to be kept in mind when writing recursive functions.</p><pre class="code invalid"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">chicken</span>() {

was used to create the test function, and <code>false</code> otherwise.</p></div><div class="solution"><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">greaterThan</span>(<span class="variabledef">x</span>) {

you call it like this, the computer does not complain at all, but just
ignores the other arguments.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">show</span>();</pre><p>You can, apparently, even get away with passing too few arguments.
When an argument is not passed, its value inside the function is
<code>undefined</code>.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will see a way in which a function body can
get at the exact list of arguments that were passed to it. This can be
useful, as it makes it possible to have a function accept any number
of arguments. <code>print</code> makes use of this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;R&quot;</span>, <span class="atom">2</span>, <span class="string">&quot;D&quot;</span>, <span class="atom">2</span>);</pre><p>Of course, the downside of this is that it is also possible to
accidentally pass the wrong number of arguments to functions that
expect a fixed amount of them, like <code>alert</code>, and never be told about
it.</p></div><ol class="footnotes"><li><a name="footnote1"></a>Technically, this wouldn't have been necessary, but I suppose the
designers of JavaScript felt it would clarify things if function
bodies always had braces.</li><li><a name="footnote2"></a>Technically, a pure function can not use the value of any external
variables. These values might change, and this could make the function
return a different value for the same arguments. In practice, the
programmer may consider some variables 'constant' ― they are not
expected to change ― and consider functions that use only constant
variables pure. Variables that contain a function value are often good
examples of constant variables.</li></ol><div class="navigation"><a href="chapter2.html">&lt;&lt; Previous chapter</a> | <a href="contents.html">Contents</a> | <a href="index.html">Cover</a> | <a href="chapter4.html">Next chapter &gt;&gt;</a></div><div class="footer">© <a href="mailto:marijnh@gmail.com">Marijn Haverbeke</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">license</a>), written March to July 2007, last modified on April 4 2012.</div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="js/mochi.js"> </script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/codemirror.js"> </script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/ejs.js"> </script></body></html>
