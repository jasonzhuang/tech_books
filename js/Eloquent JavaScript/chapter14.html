over the <a name="key1"></a>HTTP protocol. A simple <a name="key2"></a>request might look
like this:</p><pre class="preformatted">GET /files/fruit.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: eloquentjavascript.net
User-Agent: The Imaginary Browser</pre><p>Which asks for the file <code>files/fruit.txt</code> from the server at
<code>eloquentjavascript.net</code>. In addition, it specifies that this request
uses version 1.1 of the HTTP protocol ― version 1.0 is also still in
use, and works slightly differently. The <code>Host</code> and <code>User-Agent</code> lines
follow a pattern: They start with a word that identifies the
information they contain, followed by a colon and the actual
information. These are called '<a name="key3"></a>headers'. The <code>User-Agent</code> header
tells the server which browser (or other kind of program) is being
used to make the request. Other kinds of headers are often sent along,
for example to state the types of documents that the client can
understand, or the language that it prefers.</p><p>When given the above request, the server might send the following
<a name="key4"></a>response:</p><pre class="preformatted">HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Last-Modified: Mon, 23 Jul 2007 08:41:56 GMT
Content-Length: 24
Content-Type: text/plain

apples, oranges, bananas</pre><p>The first line indicates again the version of the HTTP protocol,
followed by the status of the request. In this case the status code is
<code>200</code>, meaning 'OK, nothing out of the ordinary happened, I am sending
you the file'. This is followed by a few headers, indicating (in this
case) the last time the file was modified, its length, and its type
(plain text). After the headers you get a blank line, followed by the
file itself.</p><p>Apart from requests starting with <code>GET</code>, which indicates the client
just wants to fetch a document, the word <code>POST</code> can also be used to
indicate some information will be sent along with the request, which
the server is expected to process in some way.<a class="footref" href="#footnote1">1</a></p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>When you click a link, submit a form, or in some other way encourage
your browser to go to a new page, it will do an HTTP request and
immediately unload the old page to show the newly loaded document. In
typical situations, this is just what you want ― it is how the web
traditionally works. Sometimes, however, a JavaScript program wants to
communicate with the server without re-loading the page. The 'Load'
button in the console, for example, can load files without leaving the
page.</p><p>To be able to do things like that, the JavaScript program must make
the HTTP request itself. Contemporary browsers provide an interface
for this. As with opening new windows, this interface is subject to
some restrictions. To prevent a script from doing anything scary, it
is only allowed to make HTTP requests to the domain that the current
page came from.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a name="key5"></a>An object used to make an HTTP request can, on most
browsers, be created by doing <code>new XMLHttpRequest()</code>. Older versions
of Internet Explorer, which originally invented these objects, require
you to do <code>new ActiveXObject(&quot;Msxml2.XMLHTTP&quot;)</code> or, on even older
versions, <code>new ActiveXObject(&quot;Microsoft.XMLHTTP&quot;)</code>. <a name="key6"></a><code>ActiveXObject</code>
is Internet Explorer's interface to various kinds of browser add-ons.
We are already used to writing incompatibility-wrappers by now, so let
us do so again:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">makeHttpObject</span>() {
  <span class="keyword">try</span> {<span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="variable">XMLHttpRequest</span>();}
  <span class="keyword">catch</span> (<span class="variabledef">error</span>) {}
  <span class="keyword">try</span> {<span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="variable">ActiveXObject</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Msxml2.XMLHTTP&quot;</span>);}

  <span class="keyword">throw</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="variable">Error</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Could not create HTTP request object.&quot;</span>);
}

<span class="variable">show</span>(typeof(<span class="variable">makeHttpObject</span>()));</pre><p>The wrapper tries to create the object in all three ways, using <code>try</code>
and <code>catch</code> to detect which ones fail. If none of the ways work, which
might be the case on older browsers or browsers with strict security
settings, it raises and error.</p><p>Now why is this object called an <em>XML</em> HTTP request? This is a bit of
a misleading name. <a name="key7"></a>XML is a way to store textual data. It uses tags
and attributes like HTML, but is more structured and flexible ― to
store your own kinds of data, you may define your own types of XML
tags. These HTTP request objects have some built-in functionality for
dealing with retrieved XML documents, which is why they have XML in
their name. They can also handle other types of documents, though, and
in my experience they are used just as often for non-XML requests.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>Now that we have our HTTP object, we can use it to make a request
similar the example shown above.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">request</span> = <span class="variable">makeHttpObject</span>();
<span class="variable">request</span>.<span class="property">open</span>(<span class="string">&quot;GET&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;files/fruit.txt&quot;</span>, <span class="atom">false</span>);
<span class="variable">request</span>.<span class="property">send</span>(<span class="atom">null</span>);
<span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">request</span>.<span class="property">responseText</span>);</pre><p>The <a name="key8"></a><code>open</code> method is used to configure a request. In this case we
choose to make a <code>GET</code> request for our <code>fruit.txt</code> file. The <a name="key9"></a>URL
given here is relative, it does not contain the <code>http://</code> part or a
server name, which means it will look for the file on the server that
the current document came from. The third parameter, <code>false</code>, will be
discussed in a moment. After <code>open</code> has been called, the actual
request can be made with the <a name="key10"></a><code>send</code> method. When the request is a
<code>POST</code> request, the data to be sent to the server (as a string) can be
passed to this method. For <code>GET</code> requests, one should just pass
<code>null</code>.</p><p>After the request has been made, the <a name="key11"></a><code>responseText</code> property of the
request object contains the content of the retrieved document. The
headers that the server sent back can be inspected with the
<a name="key12"></a><code>getResponseHeader</code> and <a name="key13"></a><code>getAllResponseHeaders</code> functions. The
first looks up a specific header, the second gives us a string
containing all the headers. These can occasionally be useful to get
some extra information about the document.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">request</span>.<span class="property">getAllResponseHeaders</span>());
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">request</span>.<span class="property">getResponseHeader</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Date&quot;</span>));</pre><p>If, for some reason, you want to add headers to the request that is
sent to the server, you can do so with the <a name="key14"></a><code>setRequestHeader</code>
method. This takes two strings as arguments, the name and the value of
the header.</p><p>The response code, which was <code>200</code> in the example, can be found under
the <a name="key15"></a><code>status</code> property. When something went wrong, this cryptic code
will indicate it. For example, <code>404</code> means the file you asked for did
not exist. The <a name="key16"></a><code>statusText</code> contains a slightly less cryptic
description of the status.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">request</span>.<span class="property">status</span>);
<span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">request</span>.<span class="property">statusText</span>);</pre><p>When you want to check whether a request succeeded, comparing the
<code>status</code> to <code>200</code> is usually enough. In theory, the server might in
some situations return the code <code>304</code> to indicate that the older
version of the document, which the browser has stored in its
'<a name="key17"></a>cache', is still up to date. But it seems that browsers shield you
from this by setting the <code>status</code> to <code>200</code> even when it is <code>304</code>.
Also, if you are doing a request over a non-HTTP protocol<a class="footref" href="#footnote2">2</a>, such as
FTP, the <code>status</code> will not be usable because the protocol does not
use HTTP status codes.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>When a request is done as in the example above, the call to the <code>send</code>
method does not return until the request is finished. This is
convenient, because it means the <code>responseText</code> is available after the
call to <code>send</code>, and we can start using it immediately. There is a
problem, though. When the server is slow, or the file is big, doing a
request might take quite a while. As long as this is happening, the
program is waiting, which causes the whole browser to wait. Until the
program finishes, the user can not do anything, not even scroll the
page. Pages that run on a local network, which is fast and reliable,
might get away with doing requests like this. Pages on the big great
unreliable Internet, on the other hand, should not.</p><p>When the third argument to <code>open</code> is <code>true</code>, the request is set to be
'<a name="key18"></a>asynchronous'. This means that <code>send</code> will return right away, while
the request happens in the background.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">request</span>.<span class="property">open</span>(<span class="string">&quot;GET&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;files/fruit.xml&quot;</span>, <span class="atom">true</span>);

like that, but there is a better way. A request object has a
<a name="key19"></a><code>readyState</code> property, indicating the state it is in. This will
become <code>4</code> when the document has been fully loaded, and have a smaller
value before that<a class="footref" href="#footnote3">3</a>. To react to changes in this status, you can set
the <a name="key20"></a><code>onreadystatechange</code> property of the object to a function. This
function will be called every time the state changes.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">request</span>.<span class="property">open</span>(<span class="string">&quot;GET&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;files/fruit.xml&quot;</span>, <span class="atom">true</span>);

};</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p>When the file retrieved by the request object is an XML document, the
request's <a name="key21"></a><code>responseXML</code> property will hold a representation of this
document. This representation works like the DOM objects discussed in
<a href="chapter12.html">chapter 12</a>, except that it doesn't have HTML-specific functionality, such
as <code>style</code> or <code>innerHTML</code>. <code>responseXML</code> gives us a document object,
whose <code>documentElement</code> property refers to the outer tag of the XML
document.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">catalog</span> = <span class="variable">request</span>.<span class="property">responseXML</span>.<span class="property">documentElement</span>;

the server. Their form ― tags contained inside other tags ― is often
very suitable to store things that would be tricky to represent as
simple flat text. The DOM interface is rather clumsy for extracting
information though, and XML documents are notoriously wordy: The
<code>fruit.xml</code> document looks like a lot, but all it says is 'apples are
red, oranges are orange, and bananas are yellow'.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a name="key22"></a>As an alternative to XML, JavaScript programmers have come up
with something called <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a>. This uses the
basic notation of JavaScript values to represent 'hierarchical'
information in a more minimalist way. A JSON document is a file
containing a single JavaScript object or array, which in turn contains
any number of other objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, or
<code>null</code> values. For an example, look at <code>fruit.json</code>:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">request</span>.<span class="property">open</span>(<span class="string">&quot;GET&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;files/fruit.json&quot;</span>, <span class="atom">true</span>);

    <span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">request</span>.<span class="property">responseText</span>);
};</pre><p>Such a piece of text can be converted to a normal JavaScript value by
using the <a name="key23"></a><code>eval</code> function. Parentheses should be added around it
before calling <code>eval</code>, because otherwise JavaScript might interpret an
object (enclosed by braces) as a block of code, and produce an error.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">evalJSON</span>(<span class="variabledef">json</span>) {

this means you let the piece of text run whichever code it wants.
Since JavaScript only allows us to make requests to our own domain,
you will usually know exactly what kind of text you are getting, and
this is not a problem. In other situations, it might be unsafe.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><a name="exercise1"></a><div class="exercisenum">Ex. 14.1</div><div class="exercise"><p>Write a function called <code>serializeJSON</code> which, when given a JavaScript
